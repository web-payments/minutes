15:10:37 <phariramani> Jean: Front end: web form: declarative data: E.g. PAN, CVV
15:10:44 <phariramani> PAN = Personal Account Number
15:11:09 <phariramani> CVV =  security code at back of card
15:11:36 <phariramani> secure mechanisms: 3dS, tokenization, dynamic CVX
15:11:36 <marie> marie has joined #w3cpayment
15:11:37 <dsr> ... front end with a web form, declarative data, e.g. card info. Security with 3DSecure, and more recently tokenization.
15:11:53 <stanstalnaker> stanstalnaker has joined #w3cpayment
15:12:08 <phariramani> Dynamic CVX provides better secuirty

15:13:51 <Angie> Angie has joined #w3cpayment
15:13:55 <dsr> scribe: phariramani
15:14:15 <phariramani> depends on cultural user behavior per country/usage/trusted level
15:14:39 <Parslow> Parslow has joined #W3CPayment
15:15:07 <phariramani> different rules for some functions: transaction collection, clearing/settlement, cancellation/refund, dispute, risk management, fraud detection
15:15:33 <phariramani> If token is used for txn lifecycle management then toke needs to be preserved for long period
15:16:50 <phariramani> Backed protocol is moving to ISO 20002
15:17:05 <phariramani> Slide 5: New web payment mode (crypto currencies)
15:17:30 <phariramani> Crypto tools: hash, asymmetric signatures, mathematical functions like pairing
15:17:38 <Mark_E> Mark_E has joined #W3Cpayment
15:17:46 <phariramani> currency virtualization: dynamic change currency
15:18:08 <phariramani> autonomous cryptogram contains all the data for the transaction as bank notes or coin.
15:18:29 <phariramani> Interest in reducing cross border transaction costs
15:18:43 <phariramani> in some cases can keep anonymous information on user
15:18:50 <phariramani> Slide 6: New web payment mode
15:19:11 <phariramani> Front end: P2P: Based on open source software wallet
15:19:26 <DarrenG> DarrenG has joined #w3cpayment
15:19:49 <phariramani> Front end: Also based on new internet technologies like IP (TCP/UDOP), IP Address
15:20:20 <phariramani> Slide 7: New Web Payment mode: Back end
15:20:27 <phariramani> Real time with instant balance
15:20:35 <phariramani> distributed functions for txn validation
15:20:44 <phariramani> Slide 8: Conclusion
15:20:57 <phariramani> For both ecosystems, trust and security are mandatory
15:21:20 <phariramani> PSPs also have to develop authentication, risk analysis and fraud detection
15:21:48 <erik_anderson> erik_anderson has joined #w3cpayment
15:21:56 <phariramani> Some standardization on web browser could be helpful like fingerprinting, secure inputs, API to secure client device resources
15:22:20 <phariramani> and privacy requirement on vendor
15:22:31 <virginie> virginie has joined #w3cpayment
15:22:33 <NeilMJ> NeilMJ has joined #W3Cpayment
15:23:43 <phariramani> Erik: W3C is encapsulation layer beyond a low level protocol; need to consider legacy systems while considering standards
15:24:08 <phariramani> Erik: introducing World Bank/Harish Natarajan
15:24:56 <manu2> manu2 has joined #w3cpayment
15:25:05 <phariramani> Harish: Build on topics introduced from this morning
15:25:19 <phariramani> Key findings from WB global payments survey...
15:25:43 <phariramani> Innovative = anything not based on traditional bank accounts
15:26:33 <phariramani> 11% of innovative product transactions accounted for more than 5% of electronic payments volume
15:26:46 <phariramani> 69% of innovative product transactions were growing
15:27:04 <phariramani> Slide 4: Findings & policy implications ..
15:27:38 <phariramani> Right hand corner of pie chart -> innovations could serve affordability & accessibility of payment services
15:27:44 <phariramani> Slide 5: interoperability
15:27:53 <phariramani> Interoperability generally associated with card products
15:28:30 <phariramani> Interoperability fosters competition and consumer convenience
15:28:54 <phariramani> Several levels of interoperability. Infrastructure, system wide & cross system
15:29:36 <phariramani> E.g. card level interoperability -> POS terminal in US can support cards issued by any bank as long as card adheres to standards
15:29:53 <phariramani> E.g. system wide interoperability -> Visa system
15:30:10 <dlongley> dlongley has joined #W3Cpayment
15:30:29 <phariramani> Cross system interoperability not as easily achieved
15:31:09 <phariramani> However cross membership across systems (Visa / MasterCard) could achieve cross system interoperability
15:31:51 <phariramani> Money transfer example: Typically Western Union/Money Gram generally prohibit sharing of agents; restricts interoperability
15:32:26 <phariramani> Thats sounds good. Thanks Dave
15:33:07 <phariramani> Slide 7: Infrastructure and access interoperability//use of clearing & settlement
15:33:24 <Mauro> s/Thats sounds good. Thanks Dave/ /
15:33:49 <phariramani> More than 50% of innovative products settled in books of issuer and only around 24% with central bank
15:33:56 <phariramani> Ok chaals. Good idea
15:34:11 <phariramani> Slide 9: Legal and Regulatory Considerations
15:34:34 <Mauro> s/Ok chaals. Good idea//
15:34:40 <StephanSteglich> StephanSteglich has joined #W3CPAYMENT
15:35:00 <bryan> AML/CFT = Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
15:35:23 <chaals> rrsagent, draft minutes
15:35:23 <RRSAgent> I have made the request to generate http://www.w3.org/2014/03/24-w3cpayment-minutes.html chaals
15:35:32 <phariramani> 4 main issues-> safety of customer funds; typical bank has deposit insurance however this may not apply for a non bank institution
15:36:17 <bryan> link: http://www.imf.org/external/np/leg/amlcft/eng/
15:36:20 <phariramani> Heightened AML/CTF risks: The way non bank accounts are setup created higher AML/CTF risks but can be addressed thru velocity limits, txn sizes
15:36:50 <TomPic> TomPic has joined #W3CPayment
15:36:53 <phariramani> Weaker authentication could lead to higher fraud risks. E.g. SMS used by some for operator billing
15:37:44 <phariramani> Consumer protection: when a customer signs up for credit/debit card there are very clear requirements however that is not the case with many prepaid products so customer may not be aware of what they are getting into
15:38:21 <bryan> how to know if a customer really knows what they are getting into? $64K question
15:38:35 <phariramani> Need to ensure competitive market conditions: Avoid regulatory arbitrage. Banks subject to higher constraints but non banks may have more relaxed requirements
15:39:23 <phariramani> Oversight arrangements: Typically supervision is the term used; oversight looks at impacts to system as a whole and typically function of central bank. Non banks typically fall outside of this central bank purview
15:40:12 <phariramani> Conclusion: Innovative payment mechanisms expand access, efficiency but form a regulatory perspective they need to be seen as an integral part of the national payment system of the country
15:40:17 <bryan> usecase: payment process includes user informed consent requirements about "what they are getting into"
15:40:52 <phariramani> Dave Birch: 2 of the most successful schemes (mesa and SMART Philippines) do not involve banks. Is that a coincidence?
15:41:24 <phariramani> Harish: They adopted a model that banks typically do not use (agent model) and a consumer pays model
15:41:47 <phobeo> s/mesa/MPESA/
15:41:53 <gmandyam> q+
15:41:54 <phariramani> Harish: mesa transactions have a typical 1% transaction fee but many banks are not allowed to charge users for withdrawing cash form their own account
15:42:17 <phariramani> Erik: Introducing Evan from Ripple
15:42:24 <phobeo> s/mesa transactions/MPESA transactions/
15:42:38 <chaals> [chaals wonders how much of the reason MPESA/Smart didn't come from banks is due to banks thinking "payment already worksâ€¦"]
15:42:48 <wseltzer> zakim, open queue
15:42:48 <Zakim> ok, wseltzer, the speaker queue is open
15:42:53 <wseltzer> q+ gmandyam
15:43:05 <phariramani> Evan: Ripple = global, open source decentralized payment network that connects other payment networks
15:43:22 <phariramani> Erik: Talk about how Ripple can make payments faster, easier and cheaper for everyone
15:43:34 <phariramani> s / Erik / Evan
15:43:52 <phariramani> Ripple = Global decentralized open source network
15:44:23 <phariramani> Ripple Labs = company dedicated to supporting Ripple's development
15:44:40 <phariramani> Next slide (no slide numbers unfortunately) : Ripple payments are . . .
15:45:14 <phariramani> Ripple payments are fast, free, in any currency, global and secure. Can be done in any currency, gold or any stored value
15:45:41 <phariramani> Slide: Payments technologies are not interoperable ..
15:46:11 <phariramani> payment technologies do not work together because inter network transfers are slow and expensive. Very difficult to move money cross border
15:46:29 <phariramani> Slide: Web payments need decentralized clearing and settlement
15:46:50 <phariramani> There will never be buy in for a centralized clearinghouse
15:47:06 <phariramani> Slide: Ripple connects payments technologies
15:47:19 <phariramani> Ripple takes 2-5 seconds to settle and is essentially free
15:47:41 <phariramani> Slide: Ripple connects payment networks (slide with Paypal, Bank of America logo)
15:48:02 <phariramani> Slide: Ripple has 4 broad categories of users
15:48:16 <phariramani> Basic user example is someone trying to send a payment
15:48:31 <phariramani> Merchant, market makers and gateways are the other 3 users
15:48:45 <phariramani> Slide: Send from any currency to any currency ..
15:49:05 <phariramani> Network takes care of all the exchange and this is seamless for the end user
15:49:14 <phariramani> Slide: Receive only the currency you want
15:49:35 <bryan> usecase: send money to any currency type
15:49:38 <phariramani> This is great for merchants because they can accept only the currencies they desire. No currency risk with Ripple
15:50:00 <phariramani> Slide: Market makers facilitate exchange
15:50:06 <bryan> usecase: receive money in a desired type
15:50:27 <phariramani> Market maker facilitates exchange. E.g. someone buying USD and selling Euros. Transparent to user since market maker handles this
15:50:40 <phariramani> Slide: Market makers compete on a distributed exchange
15:50:57 <phariramani> 1st open decentralized currency exchange
15:51:09 <phariramani> User does not have to worry about FX
15:51:12 <bryan> usecase: market makers acting as transfer agent
15:51:28 <phariramani> Slide: Financial institutions act as entry/exit points on Ripple
15:51:41 <phariramani> These could be Paypal, mesa, etc
15:51:51 <chaals> s/mesa/mpesa/
15:52:21 <phariramani> As long as the institutions are connected to the Ripple network this is transparent to the user.
15:52:33 <phariramani> Slide: Deal only with institutions you trust
15:52:57 <phariramani> No individual integrations required; you sign up with only one service you trust
15:53:37 <phariramani> Unlike other systems where both sender/receiver to have say signed up with Visa/MC this is more interoperable
15:53:54 <phariramani> Slide: Connected without needing any prior business arrangements
15:54:13 <phariramani> Picture of 2 Ripple gateways and market makers are between them
15:54:26 <bryan> usecase: transfer money through gateway providers of financial networks
15:54:32 <phariramani> Market makers compete to offer the best exchange between these gateways
15:55:04 <phariramani> Does not require FIs/merchants to have individual negotiations
15:55:10 <bryan> usecase: knowing through which financial network your transaction will be delivered (you might care?)
15:55:14 <phariramani> Slide: Summary
15:55:31 <phariramani> Ripple connects other payment technologies, fast easy to integrate ..
15:55:52 <phariramani> Erik introducing Max (CoinAPex)
15:56:04 <phariramani> Max: Introducing Bitcoin incubator
15:56:32 <phariramani> Mac: Interesting to talk about standardization in context of decentralized community like bitcoin
15:56:40 <phariramani> Please do take over scribing :-)
15:56:44 <phariramani> Thanks dsr
15:56:45 <dsr> scribe: dsr
15:57:34 <dsr> What's interesting is that there are lot of solutions in the bitcoin world which can move quickly, but are not necessarily what the regulators will want to see.
15:58:50 <dsr> We're seeing a split in the bitcoin community with some who want to create an identity layer on top of bitcoin and others who want to avoid any kind of centralization.
15:58:52 <bryan> the "interesting interplay" and knowing this is a concern (or may be) is one rationale for the use case of knowing how your money is being transfered (what if an international network used bitcoin internally?)
15:59:31 <dsr> What US banks and regulators will be able to do is still in progress and it will be interesting to see how it plays out.
16:00:22 <dsr> Connie Theien (US Federal Reserve), I want to take us back to legacy system and the feedback we got from stakeholders.
16:00:30 <dsr> W
16:00:51 <dsr> s/W/We've identified about 11 major kinds of use cases/
16:01:24 <dsr> ... We've document the requirements and are looking at the gaps from what is doable now.
16:02:09 <dsr> ... We want to understand where we should be focusing our efforts -- shoring up the existing systems or supporting new kinds of systems.
16:03:03 <dsr> We would like to make payment systems more accessible.  We look at ACH as an efficient system, but we want to make it more open.
16:03:52 <dsr> We've seen interest from some sources for a means to initiate cheque based payments electronically.
16:03:53 <bryan> usecase: Electronically originated checks
16:04:49 <dsr> We're also looking at the unique needs of businesses, and their specific requirements as compared to B2C.
16:05:09 <bryan> usecase: knowing what info will be required to supplement a transaction
16:05:59 <dsr> On the international side, we're looking at an ACH service that is fairly fast relative to other international payment solutions. Today this reaches 35 countries and we are looking to expand this further.
16:06:31 <r2d2> r2d2 has joined #w3cpayment
16:06:36 <bryan> X9 = http://x9.org/

16:07:20 <andym> andym has joined #w3cpayment
16:07:25 <dsr> We're interested in enabling improved security, information sharing and fraud detection.
16:07:27 <andym> andym has joined #w3cpayment
16:08:07 <dsr> This is what we're hearing from our qualitative assessment of our consultation.
16:08:15 <phariramani> ISO 20022 = http://www.iso20022.org
16:08:20 <gmandyam> q+
16:08:23 <bryan> usecase: knowing that data minimization principles are followed by systems in a payment chain
16:08:24 <dsr> Erik: I would like to open the floor to questions.
16:08:57 <dsr> Manu Sporny: an observation, it is great that all of the panelists have been focusing on their individual areas.
16:09:35 <dsr> ... I am seeing that there is a very large divide between what is said in public and what people will say privately.
16:09:58 <bryan> q+
16:10:20 <dsr> For example in respect to bitcoin and risk of legal litigation
16:11:09 <dsr> ... As far as I can see, banks don't have a motivation to switch to truly decentralized clearing solutions. Very little cross pollination with the bitcoin communities.
16:11:37 <dsr> ... It is great to see representatives from both communities sitting down together here.
16:12:52 <dsr> Max: you are going to see caution at least from a high level. Things are happening, maybe not at the pace bitcoin folks want, but progress nonetheless.
16:13:44 <dsr> If states start seeing tax dollars from bitcoin transactions, this will ease things forward.
16:14:41 <dsr> Connie: I do see the dialog starting with people keen to reach out and talk. I think there is interest in learning and understanding where the future of payment systems might evolve.
16:14:58 <TomPic_> TomPic_ has joined #W3CPayment
16:15:00 <dsr> ... Much of our focus and effort is on how we can improve.
16:15:35 <dsr> Jeromie: I would like to second Manu, it is readlly good to discuss the potential changes.
16:16:02 <steph> s/Jeromie/Jaromil/
16:16:26 <dsr> ... games are now bigger than movies, and kids are trading their WoW goods.
16:17:01 <dsr> ... we are talking too much about fraud and not enough at the opportunities for supporting new markets.
16:17:39 <dsr> Erik: not significant traffic as now on these alternative networks for governments to worry too much.
16:17:51 <cyberphone> is fixing the broken Card Not Present system in scope?
16:18:26 <dsr> Stan: Our experience with governments has been surprisingly open. It is difficult for small startups to fly and meet people.
16:19:24 <dsr> ... We need to see greater effort on non-incumbent organizations to reach out and make their case on behalf of their communities.
16:20:09 <dsr> Anonymity is a real concern in some areas of the world.
16:20:25 <dsr> ... we need to avoid setting up conflict.
16:20:28 <bryan> in an environment which a variety of decentralized / "innovative" systems may be used by money transfer networks, how important is it for users to know which types of networks may be involved, and to set preferences or express consent for their money to be transferred via such networks?
16:21:16 <stanstalnaker> stanstalnaker has joined #w3cpayment
16:21:40 <dsr> Bryan: in the environment, how important is it for standards and metadata about transactions, e.g. to enable people to know whether a given solution is more likely to be subject to scrutiny.
16:22:25 <dsr> Evan: as long as the payment solutions are trusted and secure, that's probably sufficient.
16:23:59 <phobeo> q?
16:24:08 <dsr> David Birch: as a consumer I am protected against fraud on credit cards. This is different from regulating money. Can you be a little clearer about consumer protection vs regulatory requirements
16:24:08 <jaromil> ECB paper I've mentioned https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf
16:24:38 <phobeo> q?
16:25:24 <dsr> Harish: a customer may not know, but the bank will. There needs to be a framework governing how exceptions are handled.
16:25:39 <bryan> the notion of trustworthiness and the current user transparency to how their money is transferred point to an issue of (a) who is asserting the trustworthiness (regulators?), and (2) the fact that users can currently rely upon a safe/reliable transfer system i.e. they have never had to worry about such things, so far.
16:25:59 <dsr> Evan: on Ripple, all transactions are irreversible, so there is now mechanism for charge back.
16:26:43 <bryan> q-
16:26:48 <dsr> ... Ripple is much more like a debit system than a credit system, payments only proceed if you account has the necessary funds.
16:27:24 <dsr> Harish: it is more about when a service needs to be refunded, e.g. on cancelling a flight.
16:27:58 <dsr> Evan: you could have an escrow service that only transfers the funds when the service is delivered.
16:28:22 <phobeo> s/there is now mechanism/there is no mechanism/
16:28:29 <dsr> ... The merchant would have a rock solid guarantee of receiving the funds.
16:29:18 <phobeo> q?
16:29:21 <phobeo> q+
16:29:26 <dsr> Erik: we've seen stories of people paying with bitcoin on ebay and never getting a refund on non-delivery of the product. Escrow is important.
16:30:34 <dsr> Evan: Ripple would allow card issuers to reduce their fees and it is likely that market pressure would force that.
16:31:24 <dsr> ??: will crypto currencies become important for wallet to wallet transactions?
16:32:53 <dsr> YY: VISA and MasterCard are profit driven. Merchants are tee'd up to go, but are concerned about volatility.
16:33:07 <wseltzer> s/YY/Gray Taylor, NACS/
16:33:15 <marleen> marleen has joined #W3Cpayment
16:33:50 <dsr> ... smaller payments are subject to a different risk model
16:34:12 <bryan> way long ago, I used Tradenable to sell a high-value guitar to a buyer in the UK, with international shipping required - a complex sale. the role of the escrow company was an essential one. speed of transaction or the lowest fees are often (if not always, to me) secondary to trust in the transaction.
16:34:59 <stanstalnaker> stanstalnaker has left #W3Cpayment
16:34:59 <dsr> Manu: I've just heard something really scary. Evan: you've just explained why MasterCard and VISA are unlikely to adopt Ripple.
16:35:21 <stanstalnaker> stanstalnaker has joined #w3cpayment
16:35:47 <stanstalnaker> Manu - donâ€™t forget that 50% of the interchange fee goes to the banks, so they are in the same boat as Visa/Mastercard
16:35:54 <dsr> ... We're talking about standardization process that could drive fees down, and this may deter adption, unless it is forced by governments.
16:37:32 <dsr> Max: if enough merchants switch, the market will force a transition to reduced fees. This is likely to happen in an incremental and initially small way.
16:38:32 <dsr> If the banks become more comfortable and regulators give a nod, we can expect to see change.
16:38:47 <chaals> q+ to say there is a market for visa/mc apart from interchange, and there are plenty of people living in wildly fluctuating currencies
16:39:35 <bryan> I think enabling payments on the web through APIs is orthogonal to the desire to reduce fees which I would think in user's minds is secondary to trust in the payment provider/system
16:39:38 <dsr> Evan: I expect an inevitable decline in fees as the market evolves.
16:39:56 <steph> +1 to bryan
16:40:37 <bryan> in summary we don't have to solve the international transfer problems to enable payments on the web
16:40:45 <dsr> ZZ: the only thing that is likely to be regulated is the entry point to the system.
16:40:53 <chaals> s/ZZ/Ricardo/
16:41:48 <Mauro> q?
16:41:53 <dsr> ??: regulation of virtual currency to virtual currency will happen when the volume is sufficiently high to take notice.
16:42:02 <chaals> s/??/Bailey/
16:42:08 <chaals> ack me
16:42:08 <Zakim> chaals, you wanted to say there is a market for visa/mc apart from interchange, and there are plenty of people living in wildly fluctuating currencies
16:43:11 <dsr> Chaals: We've heard about exorbitant fees especially in less regulated markets
16:43:57 <bryan> and a lot of people are paying 300% for payday loans... web payments enabling similar loans could operate a much more efficient/low-cost system for the masses of people that currently depend upon payday loan services
16:44:03 <dsr> ... bitcoins might be attractive simply on the grounds of cost. Credit cards on the other hand are attractive because they offer credit.
16:44:33 <chaals> s/of cost/of transaction cost and relative stability/
16:45:19 <stanstalnaker> q+
16:45:24 <dsr> Evan: some of those fees are due to unnecessary issues and we may be able to get rid of them.
16:45:32 <stanstalnaker> stanstalnaker has left #W3Cpayment
16:45:44 <dka> q?
16:45:57 <dsr> Max: once we see a stable future's market for bitcoin, this should address volatility concerns.
16:46:13 <marie> q?
16:46:50 <dsr> David Birch: are there any ideas for merchant run payment systems?
16:47:52 <dsr> Max: ...
16:47:59 <dezell> q+ GrayTaylor
16:48:41 <phariramani_> q +
16:49:05 <dsr> Joerg: as long as the issuing banks are receiving the interchange fees, they are motivated to continue this.
16:49:11 <steph> q+ phariramani
16:50:27 <phariramani> sorry i typed too quickly
16:50:50 <steph> q?
16:50:56 <dsr> Max: if there is no intermediary then bitcoin transfers incur no fees.

16:52:58 <dsr> Giri: can standardization realistically address the problem of bad debts for merchants of apps?
16:53:10 <gmandyam> Re: bad debt.  Many of the speakers have focused on consumer protections, but not so much on merchant protection.  There are many well-known methods where operator-direct billing can be exploited by end users to obtain electronic goods (e.g. apps).  Merchants either bear the cost through worse rev-shares or eating the costs.  Can standardization realistically address this problem (e.g. standardized receipts)?  Will they ever achieve adoption worldwide?
16:53:44 <dsr> Evan: I don't know how standards could dictate terms.
16:54:01 <dsr> ack phobeo
16:55:04 <jameslei> jameslei has joined #W3Cpayment
16:55:06 <gmandyam> Regardng my question , I didn't expect standards could address business terms.  I was asking whether standardization (e.g. standardized receipts) could be used to address bad debt.
16:55:07 <wseltzer> [wseltzer notes that W3C can make recommendations, at the behest of its members' consensus]
16:55:24 <dsr> Phobeo: if visa and mastercard removed their fees, what other reasons would merchants have for using Ripple?
16:55:42 <ernesto> q?
16:55:45 <ernesto> q+
16:56:35 <dsr> Evan: we're more likely to see competition across a wide range of payment solutions. We want to see standards that make it easier for users to have a free choice.
16:56:55 <dsr> ack stan
16:57:52 <dsr> Stan: metadata could be one answer given the opportunities for the Ripple ledger.
16:58:11 <ER> ER has joined #W3Cpayment
16:58:20 <dsr> Evan: metadata could be attached to any transaction and made public or subject to some form of access control.
16:58:35 <dsr> ... we've been thinking of SWIFT style clearing
16:59:28 <bryan> "intelligent data" (or metadata) sounds to me like a double-edged sword, especially one that comes with access control / privacy implications
16:59:45 <dsr> Max: the sky could be the limit for what could be built on top of the bitcoin technologies, but on the other hand it could be nothing (Laughter)
16:59:59 <dezell> q- GrayTaylor
17:00:37 <bryan> +1 to avoiding all discussion of fees in a standards context
17:01:01 <dsr> XX: Visa and MasterCard aren't here, so let's not refer to unjustified claims about fees
17:01:06 <ernesto> q-
17:01:30 <dsr> Evan: I was only referring to what we heard earlier.
17:01:48 <stanstalnaker> re fees and Visa/MC my comment on bank take - that information is public from MC
17:01:48 <bryan> ... except that disclosure of such fees might be useful metadata for a payment transaction, something that might drive user choice
17:02:51 <dsr> Harish: there is a question of whose metadata is involved in transactions, there is a privacy issue here.
17:03:10 <dsr> Evan: we're very interested in digital receipts and where these are stored.
17:03:23 <chaals> zakim, close queue
17:03:23 <Zakim> ok, chaals, the speaker queue is closed

17:04:05 <dsr> Erik: let me close up the session!  This is the first time I've seen all of these players in the room, but it is disappointing that MC and Visa aren't.
17:04:16 <dsr> Stephane makes some closing announcements.
