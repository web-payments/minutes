[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 Agenda: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2013Dec/0045.html
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 scribe: dlongley
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: Any updates/changes to the agenda?
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 taaz: We should talk about the PaySwarm / web-payments.org branding issue.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: Ok, we'll add that to the Agenda.
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 Topic: US Federal Reserve Response Paper
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 http://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/wiki/FedPaymentsPositionPaper
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: some of the more recent edits to the paper have made it harder to read by using language that is more complex than necessary. It comes across as a bit too lecturing and academic now, we want the paper to be accessible to general readers, we want to bring the fed in to work with us, not scare them away.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 pindar: i agree, that pretty much addresses my concerns. I leave the editing consistency etc. to you, i think we have an advantage to being totally transparent here. I ask that you tighten up the document, i would change the ordering (putting web payments first) and do some alphabetical ordering, i think the ending is great, and i like that we invite the fed to participate
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 dlongley: I've updated much of the problematic changes that make the document harder to read.
[Wed 11:38]	<voip-ps>	 <unknown> (IAX2/diamondcard-7552) has joined the conference.
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 voip: 7552 is Erik
[Wed 11:38]	<voip-ps>	 Erik is now associated with IAX2/diamondcard-7552.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we're trying to make the fed paper more accessible/open and be an invitation to the them and keep it friendly vs. how it has kind of turned out in the last few days
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: if you have any input Erik, that would be great
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: i'll take a look as soon as the call is over
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: great, that basically covers the first item, once we make some final edits we'll be in good shape ... was hoping to clear some edits with joseph on the call today, but he's not here yet
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we'll get it cleaned up and ready to submit soon. We'll submit it at 5pm ET today.
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 Topic: Branding Issue w/ payswarm.com vs. web-payments.org
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we've been going around the world talking about the web payments work, we had codenamed all this technology "payswarm" and we've got the site where everything lives right now. We've been getting some pretty strong pushback from payment companies thinking we are pushing a proprietary solution. It's a misconception on their part, and we don't know if this is some sort of strategic positioning such that they can take credit for the Web Payments work after the fact.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: So the "PaySwarm" branding is either confusing people, or people want it removed due to strategic/political reasons.  The main argument has been that they don't want a proprietary solution to the web (which PaySwarm is not at all - completely open, developed transparently, no patents, etc.). So what we can do is mirror the payswarm.com work on web-payments.org and change the messaging over to "Web Payments" and push the PaySwarm code name far lower (to the specs?).
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: to further reinforce that we're working out in the open and transparently and there's no patents we're trying to assert on this work and anyone can use it and implement it
[Wed 11:38]	<voip-ps>	 pindar (IAX2/diamondcard-124) has left the conference.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: So, it seems like the payswarm brand is getting in the way
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: i agree with that
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: putting "open" in front of everything is what the community looks for
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: still need a codename for the tech, like open payment solution or something
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: something generic
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: ok, we'll figure out where the community wants to go for the name of the tech
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: i'm sure people will have input on it, but we don't want to end up in a bikeshedding discussion about it
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we don't want the payswarm brand name to block what we're trying to accomplish here
[Wed 11:38]	<voip-ps>	 <unknown> (IAX2/diamondcard-5140) has joined the conference.
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 voip: 5140 is chaals
[Wed 11:38]	<voip-ps>	 chaals is now associated with IAX2/diamondcard-5140.
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 Topic: Web Payments Workshop
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: the announcement for the workshop went out last week
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we have our first set of chairs, we've got the beginning of the program committee, we have a fairly broad representation from mobile, offline/online payment processors, security folks, wired/wireless telcos, gsma, bloomberg, number of other folks
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we're trying to round out the program committee getting more banking and govt and retailer participation
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we're focusing on that over the next couple weeks, and doing outreach to get people to submit papers and to do presentations, etc.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we'll be finalizing chairs and committee by end of december, papers due feb 8, we hope to have the program and papers posted by beginning of march, deadline for registration is the 19th, worshop is 24-25th of march in Paris, France
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: That's where we are with the web payments workshop. We have SWIFT involved now, which is great, they are the standards group for all of the world banks. It's a big deal that they are involved along side tech companies, we are demonstrating lots of industries here, pretty broad discussion about payments on the web in general to be had.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: Pindar, we'd like participation from ICANN and Creative Commons in the workshop program committee with a deadline for december 30th and the program committee is filling up fairly quickly, so the sooner we get input from the other organizaitons you're involved with the better
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 pindar: ok, send me a side note and i'll work on that
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: anything else we should talk about or inform the public about?
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: i'm expecting that this will branch out from just payments to other financial protocols (securities, etc.) on the Web
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: i have a lot of contracts into JP morgan, etc. if you'd like me to bring in a large bank, and securities folks.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 chaals: We have to be careful abou tthe scope of this workshop. It's pretty much about payments right now - can we figure out a clean way to pay people via the Web.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 chaals: i think we don't want to go out of scope for the workshop
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: if we make it too broad it will be too difficult to move everything (payments, securities, etc.) together at the same time
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: i agree with chaals, but i'm also concerned about what Erik mentioned. We've titled it "web payments" and people are getting the impression that it's only about payments on a website. If we do justice to the protocols here, this will also be as the core protocol for mobile payments. It will be able to be extended as the core payment protocol for point of sale devices, etc. there's no reason other things can't use the web payments protocol behind the scenes as it's really just a mechanism to do payments over the Internet. It can easily extend out to retail POS and electronic cash registers, and what Erik is getting at, retail banking, larger financial sector initiatives like that.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we want the workshop to be fairly constrained in talking about how we're focused on web payments right now, because we don't want to bite off more than we can chew, but the vision is to apply this technology to all payments.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: its transfer of electronic assets, it goes as far as that because it's generic. People should understand that.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: JP morgan has had a patent on an open payment system since 1999, so it's important to have them involved.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 chaals: i think people would like to have JP involved, i dont' think it's a negative thing, there are several people who are chasing them to be involved.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we should deifnitely get them involved
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: i won't involve anyone that we don't discuss, we want to make sure we are adding value not subtracting, because every addition takes up time from others
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we'll take this back to the program committee for the workshop. There's an open question about how we're messaging the workshop to the public. We're trying to get aligned on our messaging and what exactly the scope is. We'll take this input back to the Web Payments Workshop Program Committee.
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 Topic: Web Identity and WebID differences
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2013Dec/0013.html
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: question raised on mailing list on difference between WebID spec and Web Identity spec
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: Melvin said he didn't see much of a difference, but there is a pretty big difference
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: WebID is mainly about cryptographic login on the web and they are trying to layer on top of X.509 stuff that's been built into the Web since the 90s. The basic expression of identity is the same-ish, but the Web Payments Identity stuff is very different from there on out.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: payments Web Identity is about how you store govt credentials, etc. with your online identity and read/write that identity
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: how does, for instance, persona tell a website that there's extended identity info somewhere so if you're logging into a bank and the bank wants to verify that you're a citizen of country X, how does the bank automatically do that with your approval? There is no clear answer to that question in WebID.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: the web identity payments stuff also has to do with how we tie in cryptographic assertions into someone's identity online
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: this identity mechanism that we're talking about has to enable writing to the identity (not covered by WebID), you have to be able to read specific data with permission from the identity holder, for instance, and immigration control wanted to read your info, there must be some authorization from you to let them do that, if a vendor wants your shipping address, there has to be an authorization from the identity holder to allow that to happen and we have to spec that out
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: the fifth thing that's different is that we want to be able to read and write to the identity via post and redirect, purely via web browser to bootstrap the process, but we need an automated way of doign ACL lists so you can do things like say you are fine with your bank getting your mailing address from you whenever you want, but only your bank, etc.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: that's not something the WebID group is attempting to address
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: the final thing that we're a bit different with is that we are putting into the spec how you do digital endorsements
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: this will tell institutions like banks and govts how you digitally sign information such that that information can be placed into one of these identities, so someone can issue an electronic passport, your age, etc. whatever they can do that by following this spec
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: those are the high-level differences in this spec, there's one other difference which is WebID requiring the use of Turtle as the serialization format; the people working on the web identity payments spec believe turtle doesn't have enough deployment and we'd prefer JSON/JSON-LD over something like turtle
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: that isn't to say that systems can't content-negotiate for turtle, they can certainly do that
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 Number of Web APIs tracked: 10,503
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 Number of JSON-based APIs : 4,918
[Wed 11:38]	<m4nu>	 Number of RDF-based APIs : 74
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: but based on programmable web API stats, JSON is the clear winner over RDF-based APIs and RDF uses multiple serialization formats, many of them are RDF/XML, and may not even use Turtle, but assuming they all do, it's a tiny number to compare against JSON
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: if we're creating these Web apis we have to have JSON as the primary mechanism of communication, doing anything else is going against the mainstream for how apis are done today
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: that's an overview of how this work (web identity for payments) is different from WebID
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 m4nu: we also plan to integrate with persona, etc.
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: the problem i have is that the names are ambiguous
[Wed 11:38]	<dlongley>	 Erik: identification/authorization, etc are better spelled out than using "id" and translating to other languages makes it even more difficult, as for turtle, i don't even know what it is, JSON is well known.
