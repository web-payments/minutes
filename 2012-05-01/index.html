<div class="information">Dave Longley is scribing.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We&apos;re going to discuss the payswarm vocabulary and the webcredit spec. Anything else for today?</div>
<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: PaySwarm Vocabulary</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>: <a href="http://payswarm.com/specs/source/vocabs/payswarm">http://payswarm.com/specs/source/vocabs/payswarm</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We were on the &quot;owner&quot; term.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We use ps:owner for a lot of different things, we need an ownership term. This is in the same state that it was in before. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We already talked about ownership; it&apos;s still in limbo.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We were looking for another term for it from another vocabulary.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Do we want an external term or not? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  do we want to keep owner here?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We might want to layer it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We should keep it for now, it might move to another vocab or be &quot;layered&quot; (like discussed before) but it is needed.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  moving on, validFrom specifies when some information begins being valid</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  validUntil indicates when the validity period ends</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We certainly need this, we use it for keys, listings, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  Is the reliable terminology the right usage here?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  It refers to a validity period.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  ok</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  maybe we should put these things in RDF Schema vocabulary (core web resource thing) (owner/validFrom/validUntil)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  We don&apos;t have control over that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We can ask them to add it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any question it is the right thing to do, it&apos;s just a question as to whether or not we can get it done in a reasonable time frame.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I&apos;ll talk to some people (Ivan Herman, etc.) about this.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  yeah, there were several things I have to talk to people about here.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I will talk with W3C to see if we can get these terms into a vocab.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that&apos;s that for the payswarm vocabulary.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  anything else that needs to be discussed?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We didn&apos;t really discuss the payment vocab.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  and we may just make it a &quot;layer&quot; within the payswarm vocab.</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Prefixed-terms vs. keywords for PaySwarm 1.0</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  a couple of people (eg: Pelle) have raised the point that it would be nice if we could just use terms</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  rather than prefixes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think the vocabs are simple enough so that we could do that using the payswarm context</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the keys are unique enough so that we don&apos;t have conflicts right now</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the question is whether or not we want to support that or stay with prefixes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so do we just want to use just plain terms?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think prefixed-terms are going to turn many people away from PaySwarm... the folks that don&apos;t care about Linked Data. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  It might be a good idea to just use terms, I think it&apos;ll just be more attractive for folks. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  Are we sure there are no conflicts/ [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If there are, we can change the vocabulary term to something else. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  of course people and extend this if they want to.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We allow people to use prefixed-values if they want to, right? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  yes, that&apos;s what JSON-LD is for. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  ok, I think we&apos;re all in agreement</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  lots of code we&apos;ll have to make.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  In the long run this will be better.</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Webcredit spec concerns</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  the JSON-LD spec has matured enough that we can use it as intended to deal with this.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  yes.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  Can you summarize what was going on in the thread(s)?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Michiel de Jong is the project lead for the unhosted project</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  they are trying to do decentralized payments, etc. decentralized everything.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  let you have your own data service that provides your pictures, payments, everything that facebook/twitter uses, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so what is the type of URI that you use when you want to make a payment?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Can you use a mailto: URI?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Can someone take a currency message that says &quot;EUR&quot; and agree to it?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  How are different currencies resolved/specified by URI, text, etc?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  It seems like Michiel&apos;s argument is that people will challenge the type of currency specified if how a currency is specified isn&apos;t in the spec</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think that if there&apos;s something that says { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;5&quot;, &quot;currency&quot;: &quot;EUR&quot; } in the document, I don&apos;t think courts would have a problem with that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think it would be clear what you intended to pay someone.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  I thought it was odd that anyone would think there was an issue at all.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  right; I think we&apos;re in agreement</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  His issues one by one:</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  He said he&apos;s struggling with the vagueness of the syntax</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  He says ... what if someone uses a mailto: In the currency field</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  because any URI will do</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s actually what the spec says</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the payswarm spec; so there may be no issue there.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  He said he wants the URI to point to a document explaining what the currency is</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We wanted to actually go further, we wanted it to be an endpoint where you could hit the URI and be able to get a certain amount of the currency.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  I don&apos;t know how far we want to go with this but it doesn&apos;t really matter with the URIs are ...</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  you can dereference it, but you can just use other semweb stuff to describe that URI.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  If you use a mailto: It&apos;s weird, and I don&apos;t know why you&apos;d do that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  He&apos;s saying you don&apos;t have interoperability if you do that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If two apps use different kinds of URIs they are non-interoperable</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  It isn&apos;t that one is at fault, it&apos;s just that they aren&apos;t agreeing on a common currency</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  sounds like its out of scope</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  This is not any different from having an app that don&apos;t support a currency. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  just viewing the currency field as a string ...</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  If you want to exchange value, both apps have to agree on the currency. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  If you don&apos;t support a certain currency you can&apos;t talk to the apps that do.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  It doesn&apos;t matter what the actual string is.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  yes, both apps have to understand a currency value, that&apos;s it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  It&apos;s like if someone came up to a US counter and tried to pay in EURO it wouldn&apos;t work if they didnt&apos; accept that.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  It&apos;s not different than trying to pay with &quot;mailto:&quot;.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  yes, we should just try to better explain this.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We&apos;re in agreement.</div>
<h1 id="topic-4" class="topic">Topic: Currency IRIs</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  there may be some other standards /currency IDs that are in IRI form that we could use</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  that might somewhat help with this</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there might be an IRI form with the ISO for currencies</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  I dont&apos; know there&apos;s a common standard that has IRIs in it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We say currency code in the spec because we know that we can do that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If someone makes an IRI that people accept in the future we&apos;ll just add support for that.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  It would be nice to not special case currency</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  yes, but I don&apos;t think the world is there yet</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and we don&apos;t want to have to solve that problem in PaySwarm 1.0 - we can always say we support &quot;USD&quot; today and &quot;<a href="http://some-official-currency.org/currencies/USD&quot;">http://some-official-currency.org/currencies/USD&quot;</a> in the future.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  Could we just claim our own IRIs?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We&apos;d have to go through a process that would be problematic.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  at the end it would be the W3C saying &quot;here are the URLs for the currencies in the world&quot;, and they won&apos;t be willing to do that w/o buy in from major banks and standards-setting organizations.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  getting that support might be a big political issue</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  I dont&apos; know, maybe it wouldn&apos;t be.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  this would certainly simplify our system and let us put descriptions, etc into these URLs</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Could we just use urn:currency, etc?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  Well, it would make it an IRI and simplify how we handle things</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  let me see if there&apos;s an IRI for this</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Six Interbank Clearing is the company that is in charge of this</div>
<div class="information">(for providing codes and numbers for currencies)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think it would be a pain to support the numbers</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: urn:iso4217:USD</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  should we do that just to be consistent?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Let&apos;s try to find some standard that specifies IRIs for currencies, and if there is one, use that. If not, we can revisit. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<h1 id="topic-5" class="topic">Topic: Enforce-ability of amounts in currencies</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  His next concern we sort of talked about already, if you go and buy a car and give a web credit of 2000 with a currency of EURO on it, (webcredits is an IOU system), lets say that after 2 months someone asks you for the IOU and you say that all the things you sign are in grains of sand ... so why do you want EUROs?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think it&apos;s pretty clear what a court would do in this case</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don&apos;t think that any court would find that because the spec wasn&apos;t specific enough that the buyer was never intending to buy in EUROs but always in grains of sand</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We can just add a sentence that says: If you say amount and currency, then you mean the amount in that currency.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  to the spec; that will be easy.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don&apos;t think we want to support self-issued currencies yet, which is something in the webcredits spec</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I agree</div>
<div class="information">(discussion about webcredits spec ... doesn&apos;t really apply to payswarm)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We just have to have core support for that sort of thing in payswarm, we don&apos;t need support specifically</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We made payswarm to allow extensions like this</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  I agree</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  (refers to lots of extra contract-related things that can be implemented on top of base PaySwarm spec in WebCredits spec)</div>
<h1 id="topic-6" class="topic">Topic: Range of vocabulary terms</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the payswarm spec says what goes into source and destination ... which may be different from what the vocab says (more limited)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  sounds fine to respond by saying there&apos;s no issue if the vocab terms are broad but the spec narrows it down for specific messages.</div>
<h1 id="topic-7" class="topic">Topic: Fragment Identifiers</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Michiel says everyone uses a hash URL to mean a document fragment (identify something within a document), but this breaks machine readibility</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Michiel said: &quot;everybody uses the # to mean document fragment, and the definition of a URL-with-fragment as both the document and its topic breaksmachine-readability. &quot;</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this is HTTP range 14 territory, let&apos;s not spend much time on it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  What this comes down to is this:</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  a # can be interpreted by a client however it wants to, we have a specific kind of client that participates in payswarm (a linked data aware PaySwarm client) and we mandate how to interpret those hashes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  next ...</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  some other concerns about the webcredits spec ... that, conversely, we should have covered in payswarm</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  His concern is about who owes who in a document, the spec needs to be clear and really the graphical interfaces being used to transact must actually be clear.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think we&apos;ve discussed most of Michiel&apos;s concerns</div>
