<h1 id=topic-1 class="topic">Topic: PaySwarm at W3Conf</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  W3conf presentation went well, audience mostly shy but still had 1 question</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  people came up after talk to discuss what the payment group was doing</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  talked with representatives of browser vendors, got to talk in more depth about payments and browser integration</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  browser vendors interested, but don't want to be identitfied yet. there is interest and they dont feel like our group is going the wrong direction</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  watching people do the online demo was awkward, people didnt quite know where to go</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  going to take some time to make demo website more clear about the direction of the payment process</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  should be easy to find the demo and the spec, too many legacy links right now</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  representatives from web foundation came up to chat about how these payments could be used in developing nations</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  they offered to connect us with representatives from some developing states like those in India and Morocco</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  also mentioned contacts at UN to extend payment into developing areas where poverty is high</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  very hard to get people to join the group, they want a commercial launch or something they can use</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  difficult to get people involved</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: You can see the entire presentation video here: <a href="https://www.w3.org/conf/#Web_Payments">https://www.w3.org/conf/#Web_Payments</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jose 'Manny' De Loera</span>:  Manu had a good presentation, got to see it streamed</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  presentations are up and streamable now</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  html5 demos presentation was very good: <a href="https://www.w3.org/conf/#Demo_Fest">https://www.w3.org/conf/#Demo_Fest</a></div>
<h1 id=topic-2 class="topic">Topic: Development Update</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we've been bad about giving these updates on the mailing list, where the tech is at currently - we're making good progress</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we are going to release a new demo of the payment process, protocol has been re-written</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we changed from OAuth 1 to a custom protocol, this was after much heated discussion</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  OAuth 1 had ended up making process more complicated</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  OAuth 2 will not solve the tech problems we've run into</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we'll spec out the protocol as soon as possible</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  technical issues have been worked out, need opinions about implementation feasibility</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  any questions about demo update?</div>
<h1 id=topic-3 class="topic">Topic: JSON-LD Message Format</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  typically messages have been using RDF graphs, using vocabs and prefixes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: For example: <a href="http://payswarm.com/vocabs/security#signature">http://payswarm.com/vocabs/security#signature</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this is an example of a digital signature in JSON-LD, note the use of prefixes like "sec:".</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  some feedback from W3 conference is that developers will not like colons in the vocab names</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if we don't have prefix names, we will eventually have name clashes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the problem comes from extensibility and collision prevention</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  examples of vocab clashes, names and descriptions, etc</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  people don't necessarily like prefixes, but if we remove them there will be name clashes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>: I don't like prefixes, personally</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  do we want to use prefix names or limit the system?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  should the network objects use non-prefix names?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  I do not like prefixes, complicates code</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  there might be other ways to do it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  should be one way instead of 20 to extend</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  add attributes in a sub hash or sub array</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  people from Ruby, Python, Javascript world won't like it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  there may be other extensibility considerations</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there may be a hybrid alternative, use keywords and if people want to extend it they add prefixes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  JSON-LD is flexibile enough to allow people to map values to anything they want to - JSON-LD allows you to strip out prefix values but keep object in valid form</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Johnson</span>:  This isn't exactly talking about vocab prefixes - any feedback on structures that we're using from W3Conf? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  nothing specific</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  they liked REST API and that we used JSON</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Johnson</span>:  Yes, we need to figure out if they're going to have an issue with submitting JSON vs. a form POST. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  I agree about not using JSON for form submission, regular form encoding allows people to just submit data from Ruby or Python</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  form submission might be lowest common denominator</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  wordpress plugin to payment server is JSON</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  someone putting a button on their webpage will only have a simple GET URL to attach</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  FOAF was causing problems with signatures</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  browser to server wouldn't be covered by signatures anyway</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  browser doesnt have a good way of doing signatures on POST data yet.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  one of the W3 conf presentations was about browser based encryption, so we will want to track that closely.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  keep an eye on it, move it into the browser, more technical issues but we have addressed a lot of that with the Web ID work</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  complicated digital signatures on receipts needs a more robust object than a form post</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  back to original question of prefixes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  people generally would like us to remove prefixes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Johnson</span>:  I think hybrid approach is good - strange characters in different elements on the page are an issue. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Johnson</span>:  If people use strange characters in names, they might hit strange cases... because of using that content in IDs... there may be push-back on people using prefixes. Adding terms, extending vocabularies will be an issue... people will need to add vocabularies and prefixes. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Johnson</span>:  I honestly don't know if they like ':' vs. '.' - hard to tell... maybe people have issues with ':' and not '.' [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  hard to tell why people don't like it, if some people started using the colon, they might not have an issue with it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  prefixes are confusing to the eye</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  the whole prefixing thing tended to turn people off XML, for example</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  the prefixes ended up being mostly useless information, lots of management overhead</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  enterprise developers are used to it, but a new generation of developers wont want to deal with it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  also why extensibility is important</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  don't make the basic stuff complex, allow people to add the complexity on top of that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  I suspect that it is one of the reasons RDF never took off, average developer will prefer simple naming</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  In general, we should try to get rid of prefixes if we can</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  support for JSON-LD has libraries for javascript, python, ruby, erlang, php and c++</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  but we should try to simplify, I agree.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  JSON-LD contexts will have foaf and payswarm and security and a number of others.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  but also generate a series of general terms we can use instead of prefix names</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Johnson</span>:  Yes, feedback from outside the development group working on PaySwarm is good. This stuff can be confusing - all the prefixes... [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Johnson</span>:  I'm all for simplifying it. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  Might be complicated...</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Ok, so we'll try to work this into the technical timeline after we release the demo. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<h1 id=topic-4 class="topic">Topic: Technical development after launch</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  something we have been concerned about is getting people to use the libraries and develop on the system to give feedback</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  right now we have the wordpress plugin, but we'd like other demos, like a gaming demo of someone playing an online arcade game</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we also have a radio spectrum purchase demo idea that should be worked on</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  what's the best way to set up the developers to get them building on top of this system</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Jeff would like to integrated with his smart-up</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Pelle or Manny interested?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jose 'Manny' De Loera</span>:  The gaming demo arcade idea is interesting, but I'm not a good programmer.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  not being a programmer might be a good thing, we want people to be able to integrate even if they don't have deep experience programming</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jose 'Manny' De Loera</span>:  the arcade idea tends more towards the payment process</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pelle Braendgaard</span>:  alreading implementing several things close to an authority, can add integration</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  next week is Thanksgiving, no telecon then</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  week after, we will have a meeting</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  more work on the demo and spec, website will be updated</div>
       </div>
