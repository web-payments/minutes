<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I had a discussion with Lloyd from Mozilla Persona this morning about how we could leverage persona. We have now a way of achieving what we want through persona, he verified a number of things we needing him to verify, we can go over that discussion later on.</div>
<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: Web Payments Face-to-Face meetings</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we have a number of Web Payments meetings happening around the world</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Upcoming Web Payments Face-to-Face meetings will be in: </div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Bay Area (Palo Alto, Mountain View, San Francisco)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Bali (Internet Governance Forum)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Hong Kong (Multinational Banks and Tech Sector)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Shenzen (W3C Technical Plenary)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  next week I&apos;m traveling to the SF bay area, I&apos;m doing a presentation at Google to the Chrome, Google Wallet, and requestautocomplete teams</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://payswarm.com/slides/2013/google-webpayments/">https://payswarm.com/slides/2013/google-webpayments/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that slide deck will likely change based on feedback from their payments team before i get there</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i&apos;m also doing a bay area node.js meetup</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  specifically, the talk i&apos;m giving is on linked data, RDFa and JSON-LD</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  later on in the week we&apos;re going to be talking with some other companies that don&apos;t want to be named publicly yet, fairly large tech companies</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  after the bay area i&apos;m flying out to Bali to meet pindar at the IGF</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and try and represent the web payments work that&apos;s being done here</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  the objective is to raise awareness of the group and get others to participate where relevant, the taxation element is appearing a lot more in my conversations with bankers here in hong kong, it&apos;s more an outreach effort to make governments aware that this work is happening and one aspect that is to understand the future of mobile payments and where this group may fit in, and to understand how to tax how the various txns may occur there</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we have thought about the taxation aspects ... it&apos;s built into the payswarm protocol, depending on the country, etc. the payswarm payment processor can handle the taxes based on where the sender is, receiver is, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  i think that&apos;s very attractive to hear and that&apos;s not an area that we typically harp on about but in this case it&apos;s a very nice feature set to mention</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  you think it would be helpful to mention that in bali?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  absolutely</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  a lot of peopel have no idea how to deal with the taxation aspect</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the mobile based stuff, a lot of people are saying there is no mobile web, it&apos;s just the web, the protocol works over mobile devices just like any other computer, which means the payswarm protocol taxation features work just the same over tablets, mobile devices, desktop, doesn&apos;t matter</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  exactly, great</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  next we&apos;ll be going to hong kong</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  pindar has set up multiple meetings with banks/tech sector companies over 2 weeks while i&apos;m there</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i should also point out that pindar has been incredibly generous with his time and resources to make sure we can go over to bali and hong kong to make this happen, it&apos;s greatly appreciated</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  sure it&apos;s my pleasure, i&apos;m trying to move the ball forward, to add one aspect, the HK meetings ... i sent the approx. time for public meetings, there will be some private ones, managing expectations from the financial regulators is one of the strategic aims and goals, dealing with money laundering, etc. it&apos;s early stage, it&apos;s probably a multiple year commitment, it&apos;s good to start off on the right foot,</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we&apos;ve made a breakthrough with the KYC stuff with persona this morning i believe</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  yes, talking to regulators is incredibly important and they aren&apos;t represented in the web payments group and it&apos;s been difficult to get meetings with them, if you can organize meetings for that, pindar, it would be very very helpful</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  at the end of the HK visit i&apos;m going to Shenzen to the W3C technical plenary</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we&apos;ll be telling everyoen about the web payments work and the workshop in paris in 2014</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the purpose of the workshop is to determine if the w3c should create a working group (made up of the w3c companies like bloomberg, mozilla, etc.) for web payments, ideally you get 4 large companies that want to back the working group</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  or 10 small companies</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it&apos;s clear that payments is a very interesting area taht these companies care about, it&apos;s just not clear what the exact technical work that the working group would take up, payswarm, identity, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this meeting will also be used to talk to all other groups that affect the web payments work</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  for example the Web Crypto group will be working on tech that affects what we do, it helps making web payments easier to do and more secure, we have people from the sysapps group working on NFC and that would allow us to do like pay with your mobile phone through a web browser to an NFC device at a checkout kiosk, pay for movie ticket, groceries, etc. or just transfer money by tapping phones together</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so work at the technical plenary will be to join that group and make sure they have the web payments use cases in mind when they are creating these technologies</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  aside from that there are other publishing groups there and meeting various other people, GSM association there, giving everynoe an update, giving a presentation on what we&apos;ve been able to accomplish this year on web payments is all on the agenda, after shenzen is coming back to the states</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  next is the web payments workshop which is in nov</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Identity, Payments, and Persona</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://payswarm.com/minutes/2013-09-25/#topic-5">https://payswarm.com/minutes/2013-09-25/#topic-5</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  chatted with lloyd@mozilla, head of persona team</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this morning, continuation of discussion from 2 weeks ago, core here has to do with creating an identity mechanism for the web that is also useful to banks, financial, and govt institutions</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the idea is having an identity on the web that is capable of asserting that you are a citizen of a particular country, you are a certain age, live at a certain address, etc. all these things can be tacked onto this identity</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the payswarm work has a rough spec for what this would look like, and what we didn&apos;t know until this morning was if we could integrate web payments identity with mozilla persona</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  for example, mozilla persona is meant to be email identity mechanism, simple, built into the browser</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  all it does is provide website you&apos;re logging into with a verified email address, website doesn&apos;t have to verify your email address anymore, you just click to log in with your email address on a website and the website now knows the email address is valid and have an identifier for you</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the missing piece was the ability for the persona assertion, so when you have an identity provider like google, meritora, or payswarm and you can use an assertion that says this email address is real and belongs to the person holding this document</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the missing piece is being able to specify the payment processor for that identity or who controls that persons address/govt issued information/who is the gatekeeper for that info</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i talked with lloyd and we hammered out a rough plan for how to integrate with the web payments id mechanism</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the payswarm authority would become a persona identity provider</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: dave@meritora.com or dave@paypal.com</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so payswarm authority would give you an email address</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  when you log into a website you&apos;d select that identity</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  when that assertion is sent to that website, it would not only contain your email address but also your web payments identity information</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: so, something like - paymentIdentity: &quot;<a href="https://dev.payswarm.com/i/manu&quot;">https://dev.payswarm.com/i/manu&quot;</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that URL would be injected into the assertion, and the website can then bootstrap the rest of the process</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the website can hit that URL and retrieve the person&apos;s govt issue ID info, SSN, whatever that person permits</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  lloyd felt that it was the best way to extend persona, it doesn&apos;t require much work for them, they are happy with us being the canary in the mine proving that this can be done</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  what&apos;s the access control information for that?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we&apos;d have access control stuff that mirrors how we do it for payments right now</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so if a website wanted to get your shipping address they would make a request to the payswarm payment processor and then the processor would say access denied and say the user has to authorize you, then a pop up would show that the website wants certain information and the user has to say yes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and then that information is sent to the vendor&apos;s website</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the vendor&apos;s request would just include what they want using a JSON-LD message</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  does that answer your question?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  yeah, there are a lot of details there, but yeah</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  yeah, the Read-Write-Web group are working on this problem too</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the persona people care a lot about this problem too but don&apos;t have spare cycles to work on it, he was very apologetic for not having more resources</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there are multiple other groups that care about this problem and are working on it as well</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so we&apos;ll have some help and coordination</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Web Payments Technical Specifications Strategy</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  some people haev been pinging me off line saying it seems like the group has been fairly scattered in its discussion, talking about bitcoin, philosophy of payments, DRM and censorship, meanwhile we have mozpay and payswarm and discussions around the world with banks, financial institutions and tech companies, to anyone who just joined the group it seems like a wall of information</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  they are being hit with and it&apos;s raising the question, where is the group going to focus its time ...</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  is it going to be a lot of discussions where we pick something out of the soup or do we have a clear technical path</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this is going to be an issue when we try to create the working group</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the question that will be asked is &quot;what is the technical output of this group going to be?&quot;</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we won&apos;t get a group until we have a clear answer for that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we could start this conversation off by talking about the things that are more or less done or could be standardized soon</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so let me get some of the specs up here</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  in general, there are specs that are going through that would go through without the web payments group, RDFa is already a REC, it&apos;s done, and we use RDFa to express products for sale on the Web, that work started in 2004 and we were done in 2008 and a new version was published just this year 2012-2013: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/">http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/</a> </div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-rdfa/">http://www.w3.org/TR/html-rdfa/</a> </div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   JSON-LD is the technology we use for the financial messaging: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we have 6 implementations with 5 that pass all tests</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  other implementations are out there that are limited</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we are trying to get the spec out this year but some process stuff is getting in the way</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so for the payswarm and mozpay stuff we have prereqs out there</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  at the end of the mozpay discussions it was sounding like they wanted to use JSON-LD</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it sounds like, for the future of the web, it looks like JSON-LD is the messaging format</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it seems like JSON-LD is favored</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  those are things that will be done regardless of whether or not there&apos;s a web payments group</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/rdf-graph-normalization/">http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/rdf-graph-normalization/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we have a number of specs that could be put into the web payments group</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there&apos;s somethign called RDF dataset normalizatoin</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it is used to make sure messages can be digitally signed and verified</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://payswarm.com/specs/source/http-keys/">https://payswarm.com/specs/source/http-keys/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we need dataset normalization in order to have any of the payments stuff work out, or we have to use the JOSE spec and it isn&apos;t ideally suited for financial/extensible tech</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we could also include the http-keys spec, this allows us to do digitally signed messages, to do requests for transactions that are digitally signed in json-ld, we have a nice Web PKI that&apos;s a result of this messaging spec</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it also does KYC on the Web which ties in nicely with persona</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that&apos;s a pretty solid argument for the w3c for picking it up</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there are at least 2 specs that the web payments group could kick off with that are more or less done, we wouldn&apos;t have to do much with them</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  those are foundational payment technologies, they are generic ... they could be used for anything, the argument that they should go into the web payments group is a discussion we&apos;ll need to have</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that brings up to the meat of the issue</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so what are we standardizing as the payment protocol here?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we have bitcoin, which is being standardized at the bitcoin foundation, they haven&apos;t been heavily involved in the web payments group but there has been discussions here</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  they dont&apos; have spare bandwidth to go off and write bitcoin specifications, they mostly do code</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the idea that we would end up working on bitcoin-specific technology is probably not going to happen in the web payments group</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  unless we get a lot more contributions from that community</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the other group is Ripple, we&apos;ve been having good offline communications with them, their protocol is open and on the web, their source code is open, the Ripple folks have been on these calls before and they have wanted to figure out a way to work with the web payments group</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i don&apos;t think we&apos;ll have anything by 2014 to work on, but i am having meetings with them soon so that could change</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the third thing that could be used on the web payments group is a generalized payment frame that is not spoofable or is whitelisted and this used to be part of mozpay and it&apos;s something that mozilla is interested in pursuing there is no spec for it, just ideas floating around for what it could be</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the purpose of the frame was initially for web payments, but now they seem to be on shaky ground for what they&apos;d want to standardize</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://payswarm.com/specs/source/web-payments">https://payswarm.com/specs/source/web-payments</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that brings us to payswarm</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://payswarm.com/specs/source/web-commerce">https://payswarm.com/specs/source/web-commerce</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there&apos;s several specs for payswarm we could work on</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://payswarm.com/specs/source/payment-intents">https://payswarm.com/specs/source/payment-intents</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  those specs are in a fairly rough state, but are certainly in a position to be picked up by a web payments working group</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://dev.payswarm.com/">https://dev.payswarm.com/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we have solid implementations for the specs so we know that they work from a technical standpoint that they work</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so the question is what should we propose to the w3c for standardization</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  our organization, Digital Bazaar, is really pushing the payswarm stuff, mainly becauset here&apos;s nothing else that does what it does</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we don&apos;t yet have Ripple saying they want a w3c spec or standard, same for bitcoin, we do have the people that that are working on the payswarm stuff</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that stuff is improving and we are updating the specs and standards as we go</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  as far as i see it, the only potential pitch we have for the w3c is that we would like to standardize the identity and payments stuff that payswarm has outlined and the RDF dataset, http-keys specs</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we would also like to standardize some kind of secure browser frame that mozilla is going to be working on over the next year</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  whether or not that will fly at a group level or not i have no idea</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  at this point we have 100 people in the group and it&apos;s pretty difficult to get a read on where the group wants to head</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I suspect that the group would be okay with the path, we could say that&apos;s the path we think we should take and see what they say. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  all the payswarm work you&apos;ve done is very open and transparent and i&apos;d agree with that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  that&apos;s very clear and consistent with what i understand from the list</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  the intersection of policy and technology here is quite intricate, and i do think some of the discussions happening are quite important, it might be good to add some structure to separate between technology and policy in those discussions</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  some bifurcation might be necessary</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  one of the things we&apos;ve tried to avoid in the past is to create separate mailing lists</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  these things, as you said, are intricately linked, it&apos;s hard to talk about tech without mentioning policy</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  philosophical discussions have a direct impact on the tech built</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it&apos;s important to separate them where we can, but often we come back to core philosophical discussions and they tend to be painful and drag out for a long time, but it&apos;s improtant to understand the philosophy that&apos;s underpinning the decisions being made in this group</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  what i was suggesting then was a reference document or wiki that could state the status of the participants or their values/principles or architectural principles as a statement of policy because you are implementing policy through the code that is written, i guess get something more document driven is what i&apos;m edging for</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i agree, there are fundamental things here like tech created by the web payments group must be usable by people in emerging nations, industrialized countries, people on mobile devices, without leaving anyone out</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  tech should be accessible to all, take into account people with disabilities, people who don&apos;t have access to infrastructure like banks, outlining those things in a document would be very useful</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  they get lost in the mailing list</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we need to have a document that ends up formalizing that kind of stuff</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if we can direct that energy to a document i&apos;m very supportive of that, the mailing list being the history of how that derived is very important</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  anything else on the direction/proposing it to the group?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  i think this is a very productive conversation to have this time of year, there needs to be technical discussions to get work done and progress made</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it&apos;s not that w3c will be inflexible about this, it&apos;s just about the fact that when a group gets chartered, it needs to have a clear list of things ... if you had things you have to go through a 6 month process to get rechartered</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if we say we&apos;re going to do RDF dataset normalization, http-keys, and payswarm</div>
<div class="information">and the frame window</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and it will take 4 years to finish, but if mozilla wants to change something or add to it, in order to get it to standardization we have to recharter the group and go back to the w3c companies and get approval</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it ends up taking months to do</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so the only reason i&apos;m saying that we have to propose something at the workshop is that we have to make sure we have something for the initial charter</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  absolutely makes sense</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  so the conversation on this list is really important leading up to 2014</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  so everyone is in the best possible position for next year</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  if the policy document could be done by early next year would be great and would see if this group will be coherent, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  maybe we should just kick start that policy document this week or next</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  it would be lovely to be able to farm off this discussion into an area where policy level inputs, regulators, etc could all be participating</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  let&apos;s raise this at the IGF and see what comes forward, try to get that domain expertise participating at the right time at the right level</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  it would be good to mention at the IGF we&apos;re at the process of doing this, making it document driven would be very useful</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  ok that gives us something very concrete to work on</div>
<div id="action-1" class="action">ACTION: Create a Web Payments policy document that outlines the sort of technology that should be created by the Web Payments group.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  If we&apos;re going to have a policy document, we may want to have a document to say which technologies are intended to implement it. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Pindar Wong</span>:  Absolutely agree with that. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://payswarm.com/specs/source/use-cases/">https://payswarm.com/specs/source/use-cases/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we could probably drive it off of the payswarm use cases</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  those use cases are kind of a pseudo policy document</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Madhu Nott</span>: bye</div>
