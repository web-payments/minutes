08:01:31 <bryan> Dave_Birch: kickoff on consumer and merchant experience with focus on the frontend
08:01:48 <bryan> ... people have asked why look at this? things work OK
08:01:58 <Angie> Angie has joined #w3cpayment
08:02:10 <bryan> ... but they dont really work for consumers and merchants, basically

08:03:01 <eriko> eriko has joined #W3Cpayment
08:03:11 <bryan> ... the paypal payment method did not work, got locked out after three tries due to some suspicion
08:03:37 <bryan> ... puzzling as my paypal app knows who and where I am.
08:04:01 <wonsuk> Present+ Wonsuk_Lee
08:04:07 <bryan> ... the app could figure this out, and just do it since its only 30 euros. we would be moving to the right experience

08:04:59 <virginie> virginie has joined #w3cpayment
08:05:21 <bryan> ... I use Halo in london (taxi service). the app shows you the license # and picture of the driver. you tell them where you're going, you get there, and walk off. payment is automatic. there is no payment experience.
08:05:26 <mdadas> mdadas has joined #w3cpayment
08:05:53 <bryan> ... no one looks forward to payment, they look forward to buying stuff. payment needs to be transparent, out of the loop
08:06:13 <kjheimark> kjheimark has joined #w3cpayment
08:06:20 <Floris> Floris has joined #W3CPAYMENT
08:06:46 <bryan> ... all sorts of clever stuff will enable this experience. where is dave, is this activity normal, don't bother him.
08:06:55 <manu3> manu3 has joined #W3Cpayment
08:07:06 <bryan> ... we should make the experience vanish, set the bar high.
08:07:30 <bryan> ... its not good to make it easy for me to type in a card . that's a hack.
08:07:38 <phobeo> s/Halo/Hailo/
08:08:12 <bryan> ... cards as the central metaphor for payment is anachronistic. we dont want to make cards work better on the web. its 1949 tech, and too dangerous now.
08:08:23 <Ori_Eisen> Ori_Eisen has joined #W3Cpayment
08:09:12 <bryan> ... knowing that use of cards is risky, and that eventually you will be attacked, please imagine further forward.
08:09:17 <dka> dka has joined #w3cpayment
08:09:54 <bryan> ... starting with a merchant perspective now
08:10:15 <kennyluck> kennyluck has joined #W3Cpayment
08:10:33 <bryan> ... Gray Taylor (NACS - @grayotaylor)
08:10:42 <Angie> Angie has joined #w3cpayment
08:11:33 <bryan> Gray_Taylor: represent PCATS & NACS, attached to convenience stores in the US, involved in system data exchange
08:12:03 <bmathis> bmathis has joined #w3cpayment
08:12:04 <bryan> ... payments is 30% of our effort. mobile commerce will increase that, so we are focused on this work today
08:12:54 <bryan> ... where are we? the system is broken. in the 70s there was no need for data visibility, data was static, magstripe based
08:13:23 <bryan> ... a lot of people are being hacked. 1.6B cards, 1.5B have been reissued.
08:13:58 <bryan> ... this is about a 10$B problem in the US, just the cost of fraud to banks
08:14:17 <m4nu> Gray: Fraud cost is 6 basis points... that's just due to fraud.
08:14:18 <bryan> ... another problem is segmentation of the customer to the merchant. knowing your customer is important.
08:14:36 <bryan> ... e.g. walmart needs to know who is buying what, and they don't want to get that data from mastercard
08:14:54 <bryan> ... due to data security, we are moving to EMV
08:14:57 <james> james has joined #W3Cpayment
08:15:39 <bryan> ... we are last getting on this tech, and it's not a good feeling.
08:15:46 <korz> korz has joined #w3cpayment
08:16:12 <bryan> ... what can we do? we wish that mobile was ready, because we feel like a real late comer to an old tech
08:16:42 <bryan> ... major oil companies have no plans to implement EMV, due to poor ROI
08:17:25 <bryan> ... incrementalism in the card business creates heartburn. todays system is based upon the account, more important than the person.
08:17:48 <bryan> ... the system is moving toward the person, who can select the card. card companies don't like that, banks are ambivalent
08:18:03 <lesellier> lesellier has joined #w3cpayment
08:18:20 <bryan> ... W3C's job is to boil this ocean. this is a critical subset of global commerce, and shouldn't be a walled garden for the web
08:18:36 <bryan> ... tech has the ability to overturn monopolies
08:19:05 <bryan> ... US Payments SOI 2016 slide
08:19:29 <korz> @bryan i like the focus on the person, not card. good step
08:19:37 <bryan> ... debit is the single largest thing going forward, driven by the banking crisis in 2008
08:19:47 <bryan> ... people are living in their means more now
08:20:14 <bryan> ... 2006-7 we hit equilibrium with paper on the way out
08:20:57 <bryan> ... cstore profile vs card fees graph shows fees pulling away from pretax profit
08:21:12 <erik_anderson> Was that a use case? 2 fat guys arguing over a ham sandwich?
08:21:23 <bryan> ... the fees are passed onto consumers, 1$B of subsidization
08:21:32 <bryan> ... the only higher cost is labor
08:21:50 <m4nu> Gray: If you pay cash, you pay over $400 a year to subsidize the card industry.
08:22:18 <bryan> ... re cost/liter, 2/3 of margin is gross profit
08:22:31 <bryan> ... much is cost of unauthenticated card use
08:22:55 <bryan> ... focusing on business and consumer in the payments ecosystem
08:25:14 <bryan> ... (totally lost on this slide - not sure what's being said...!)
08:25:46 <bryan> ... customers get steered to where discounts are offered
08:26:18 <bryan> ... re method of payment, they are changing, polluting the card handling environment
08:26:43 <bryan> ... we have to enable these methods but not have them affect the card vendor environment
08:27:26 <bryan> (discussion about PCI... not sure who is talking)
08:27:30 <gmandyam> gmandyam has joined #W3Cpayment

08:27:43 <schuki> bryan: surname is king i think
08:27:49 <schuki> bryan: jeremy king?!
08:27:51 <Ori_Eisen> Jeremy King is speaking, from PCI
08:28:20 <bryan> (seems like an internal conflict in the payment industry. don't know the context, terms, etc... can't scribe this well)
08:28:29 <kodonog> kodonog has joined #w3cpayment
08:28:45 <bryan> (please add notes anyone if you understand this)
08:29:04 <bryan> ... we are turning a battleship here. PCI has helped re a finite set of things to look at
08:29:10 <AxelNennker> AxelNennker has joined #w3cpayment
08:29:10 <bryan> (anyone know what PCI is?)
08:29:29 <mountie> Payment Card Industry
08:29:36 <mountie> DSS Data Security Standard
08:29:38 <schuki> bryan: standards council, security I think
08:29:41 <bryan> ... it's a huge science project to become compliant. our #1 threat vector (dispenser skimming) was excluded from PCI
08:29:54 <wseltzer> -> https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/ PCI
08:29:56 <bryan> ... defending PCI, it provided a clearinghouse to mitigate risk
08:30:11 <andym> andym has joined #w3cpayment
08:30:31 <bryan> ... when it comes to trust, banks are #1, the crisis dipped that, but they are still #1 going forward
08:30:46 <bryan> ... payments in flux - the perfect storm
08:30:59 <bryan> ... for profit without competition is bad
08:31:01 <TomPic> TomPic has joined #W3CPayment
08:31:10 <phobeo> bryan: Dave asked Gray about how much fraud had gone down since the PCI implementation. Jeremy complained about this being out of order. Dave responded that he wanted the data point to know what did merchants get back from this investment and there was discussion about which other areas this helped on. There was admission that they were slightly better off with it but not sure if it wasn't worth it to redo the whole security model, but for now they had [CUT]
08:31:25 <bryan> ... bank brick and mortal infratstructure is a cost holding them back
08:31:41 <bryan> ... it will be difficult to get the profit margin from the banks
08:31:51 <chaals> s/mortal/mortar/
08:32:12 <phobeo> bryan: for ref pci dss docs are at https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/
08:32:20 <bryan> ... a consumer focus will be required, mobile and online banking will be changed by focus on the consumer
08:33:00 <m4nu> Gray: We need to re-think how we do digital identities and security.
08:33:10 <bryan> ... mobilization will rise, mobile wallets are will become the mobile briefcase. digital identities and megabit encrypted PINs are where we need to get to
08:33:37 <bryan> Dave_Birch: digital ID problem is underlying many of these problems
08:33:47 <bgidon> bgidon has joined #W3cpayment
08:34:17 <bryan> Gray_Taylor: with trust credentials, we can take ACH from Zimbabwe and be reasonably assured for it
08:34:29 <m4nu> Gray: With the appropriate trust credentials floating around, I could bank w/ different people and decrease fraud.
08:34:33 <AxelNennker> ACH=?
08:34:43 <bryan> ... re tokenization, there are about 6 standsards
08:35:19 <AxelNennker> thanks m4nu
08:35:52 <bryan> ... we need to kill standards as readily as we create standards - look at what's out there to leverage it, that will ease globalization
08:36:02 <bryan> ... Digital Identity
08:36:43 <bryan> ... counterfit IDs are easily obtained. transaction auth is similar to the boarding process
08:37:04 <bryan> ... all of the financial system is depending upon authentication of the individual
08:37:17 <m4nu> Gray: Digital identity will preserve our freedom online, not take it away.
08:37:20 <bryan> ... this is something that will preserve freedom
08:37:36 <m4nu> Gray: There is still no way to digitally sign any contract, how dumb is that?
08:37:41 <bryan> ... guiding access, medical records, etc...
08:37:43 <erik_anderson> +1 passport is one of the weakest areas in need of security enhancements and digital ID's
08:38:01 <m4nu> Gray: I believe in standards - that's the way forward.
08:38:08 <Jorg> Jorg has joined #W3Cpayment
08:38:16 <bryan> ... i believe in standards, you need to come up with building blocks. any safe system has not reached volume yet
08:38:32 <bryan> ... we need plausible deniability of risk
08:38:59 <bryan> ... what are the best practices systems should be following? consumers are just kicking the tires, and hacks can take wind out of the sales
08:39:44 <bryan> ... uniform datasets; at the end of the day, moving money is not rocket science; datasets need to be flexible and amended per the payment type
08:40:08 <bryan> ... re digital receipt standards, look to fiscal receipt standards
08:40:12 <m4nu> Gray: Important to bring more data into the digital receipts, look to people that need fiscal reporting in their receipts.
08:40:19 <melvster> melvster has joined #W3Cpayment
08:41:12 <bryan> ... "out of the box" use cases; data security is about minimizing value and maximizibng effort; hacking ROI needs to be low
08:41:41 <bryan> ... we need to look to how we can keep credentials in a small ecosystem and use tokens outside it
08:41:45 <m4nu> Gray: We should keep credentials in a small ecosystem, use tokens/intermediaries.
08:42:26 <bryan> Robin_Berjon: I work for W3C, editing HTML
08:43:09 <kennyluck> kennyluck has joined #W3Cpayment
08:43:29 <bryan> ... acronym blizzard ... things are sinking in; from the perspective of the web platform, these thoughts are about how we can work together for payments on the web
08:44:09 <bryan> ... it would be easy to standardize what is done today; APIs would be easy. but they would not be innovation conducive
08:44:43 <bryan> ... a better approach is an "intents" based approach; like HTTP, when you ask for something you don't know what will result, you just  get something back
08:45:46 <bryan> ... we can reproduce a similar system for payments, avoiding the "nascar" problem, i.e. that user have to choose among a lot of logos for providers e.g. socnet "share" buttons; this hurts the small players
08:46:27 <bryan> ... "intents" on the android platform indicates something the user wants to do; the user is allowed to pick among services that are available to them
08:46:53 <bryan> ... we can include payment in the intents architecture as an "intent to pay"
08:47:13 <bryan> (I think I said the same thing yesterday, and it was in the discussion of web intents earlier)
08:47:46 <bryan> ... intents can provide a very simple flow for the web platform, that is orthogonal to the underlying payment system
08:48:38 <bryan> Dave_Birch: we didn't test the notion of being able to pay without any understanding of the underlying payment system; to decouple it sounds great but it is real;
08:49:03 <bryan> Robin_Berjon: domain experts need to help us with the mapping to the payment level
08:49:33 <bryan> ... we need to avoid locking ourselves into what payment is today, and move to decoupling at the design level
08:49:47 <dsr> rrsagent, make minutes
08:49:47 <RRSAgent> I have made the request to generate http://www.w3.org/2014/03/25-w3cpayment-minutes.html dsr
08:49:51 <m4nu> Use Case: Decouple payments as much as possible. Base on an intent-to-pay mechanism
08:50:41 <bryan> Cyril_Vignet: I work for BPCE, a bank in France; I have worked in the payment systems for 25 years
08:51:11 <bryan> ... focusing on one point from the paper, the SEPAmail project
08:52:22 <bryan> ... we have clients, merchants, cardholders, etc; B2B, B2C... there is a lot of savings that could be made, Euro billions, to be saved
08:52:47 <bryan> ... the idea of SEPAmail was to define not only a protocol but how actors interact
08:53:12 <bryan> ... slide 2 Trusted Third Party Processors
08:53:35 <bryan> ... TTPP Trusted Third Party Processors
08:54:11 <bryan> ... ABC Inc talks to TTPPs in a trapezoid arch to Alice
08:54:38 <bryan> ... SEPAmail is based upon web standards, ISO 20022 or xlm data formats
08:54:42 <TomPic> Intend is nice but might be preventing the user to discover new services, no ?
08:55:26 <dsr> SEPAmail uses web/internet standards to encapsulate ISO20022 or xlm data format for payments via trusted third party processors.
08:55:47 <bryan> ... the protocol is mandatory between the TTPPs, optional between the endpoints and TTPP
08:56:19 <bryan> ... what we want to avoid; one party must be connected to the TTPP of the other party (thus the trapezoid arch)
08:56:39 <bryan> ... each client can choose their TTPP
08:57:53 <bryan> ... we also want to avoid subject-specific protocols, and use encapsulation for that
08:58:38 <bryan> ... we also want to avoid ACH or CSM; these are not very well regulated; ACH is quite expensive; much less than manual but still expensive
08:59:09 <bryan> ... it was important not to have a central monitoring point, enabling freedom to do what you want
09:00:08 <bryan> ... experience with SEPAmail; based upon ISI 20022, with different layers for bill presentment, direct debit e-mandates, IBAN control, data along payments
09:00:44 <skddc> skddc has joined #W3Cpayment
09:01:28 <bryan> ... (discussing EPC...not sure what the points being made are)
09:02:36 <bryan> ... (what is IBAN?)
09:03:01 <bryan> ... we will launch this in 2014 a network for TTPPs
09:03:40 <marie> [crÃ©dit mutuel, crÃ©dit agricole, sociÃ©tÃ© gÃ©nÃ©rale, BPCE, @@ banks in France}
09:04:02 <bryan> ... design is in progress, "families for TTPP than may not be PSP" (someone explain if possible...)
09:04:31 <bryan> ... SEPAmail is an "overal arch that solves (part) of the auth problem"

09:05:17 <dezell> dezell has joined #w3cpayment
09:05:35 <bryan> ... example of the "APPHIRE family", implemented this three years ago. it's very simple from the banks' view; self-care for the user
09:06:02 <bryan> ... the corresponding private keys is in the mobile, in the secure element or NFC card
09:06:07 <dsr> s/APPHIRE/SAPPHIRE/
09:06:19 <bryan> ... if the payment is low, you may not need very high security
09:07:12 <bryan> ... with this generic approach we have demonstrated ability to support more things beyond payment
09:07:28 <lesellier> lesellier has joined #w3cpayment
09:07:47 <bryan> ... SEPAmail is CC-SA Paternity licensed
09:08:18 <phobeo> link is wrong in the slide, should be http://documentation.sepamail.eu/
09:08:21 <justmoon> justmoon has joined #W3Cpayment
09:09:26 <bryan> Joseph_Potvin: here I am as an economist, 15 years in the IT domain
09:09:40 <bryan> ... re the UI for digital payments
09:09:43 <Angie> Angie has joined #w3cpayment
09:10:05 <bryan> ... leave it up if you clicked on conversion options in paypal's screen
09:12:27 <bryan> ... amounts were quoted in local and Euros; this illustrates and underlying assumption, that there is only one exchange rate option; this example though showed other options e.g. between paypal and mastercard/visa, the diff being whether you know the rate at the time of the transaction
09:13:25 <bryan> ... I chose the credit card, due to fewer intermidiaries, rather than use paypal then intermediaries
09:14:28 <bryan> ... re philosophy of money; the tokenization of human obligations; a means of accounting them
09:14:53 <bryan> ... if we did UML for the payment process, three use cases for money
09:15:43 <bryan> ... unit of account; medium of exchange (communications); value aspect (descriptors or standard of deferred payment, stored value - I call it a value benchmark)
09:16:19 <bryan> ... doing the use case and relationship diagrams in UML; who are the stick figures?; who gets to choose the value benchmark etc?
09:17:03 <bryan> ... we are used to those choices; but not for this example (the exchange rate options showed earlier)
09:17:42 <bryan> ... in this paypal example, who got to choose the value benchmark? there were two parties in the transaction, did either get to choose?
09:17:55 <bryan> ... happy that paypal provided this choice, but whose role is it?
09:19:09 <bryan> ... example of a taxi and porter to the check-in. if the porter opens the bags and takes something "it's my business model to take something" - it's not the intermediary's role to determine aspects of price, rather to define service fees
09:19:27 <bryan> ... conversion rate is not a service fee, it's a component of the money
09:20:12 <bryan> ... there is a lot more to this example choice than is apparent
09:20:32 <bryan> ... in the WWW, we need a way to code these things
09:21:14 <bryan> ... thinking about this in the UML terms, where do the lines go and what roles do the actors have, this is a direct line to the theory of money
09:21:31 <r2d2> r2d2 has joined #w3cpayment
09:22:19 <bryan> Neil_Mason-Jones: I represent Trans-Africa Solutions, a South Africa startup; bringing the emerging market / unbanked perspective

09:22:37 <kodonog> kodonog has joined #w3cpayment
09:22:38 <steph> steph has joined #w3cpayment
09:22:39 <bryan> ... the market is very difficult to authenticate
09:22:53 <bryan> ... we are trying to meet them in the way they want to transact; mostly cash
09:23:00 <phobeo> small highlight over Josephs comments: many payment providers, including paypal, do not call this a conversion but mention it specifically as "cross border and currency conversion fees", as there are both variable and fixed costs associated with the networks they use to move money
09:23:19 <bryan> ... in SA we have a huge divide in economic capability
09:23:24 <phobeo> so yes, they are fees and you accept them as so on the payment terms and conditions
09:23:59 <bryan> ... re the unbanked, in SA as much as 80%, scenarios such as this occur; in the living in city center, traveling back to home is very expensive
09:24:09 <Jonny> Jonny has joined #w3cpayment
09:24:18 <bryan> ... outside the city center, you can spend a lot just going to buy a ticket
09:24:42 <bryan> ... we find that there is a resistance to putting cash anywhere, in wallets or savings
09:25:23 <bryan> ... we are trying to bridge the last mile, using the mobile devices, libraries or cafes to access the product, gain a token and make a payment in a physical location
09:25:34 <bryan> ... tokens can be barcodes, QR codes, etc
09:26:07 <bryan> ... this is slightly different use case; between request and receipt, it can take days
09:26:50 <bryan> ... its easy to expect all to be online; that the offline are not that large a subset; that may be but we need other options and fluidity to support them
09:27:55 <bryan> ... also there's a large opportunity for tech to help; but in Africa charges are obscene re the service bring provided; people thus distrust the banks; in the UK it is very different, the cost factors are so low
09:28:20 <bryan> ... tech talked about in this meeting e.g. crypto currencies can have large impact in emerging economies
09:28:46 <bryan> ... though banks etc resist on every possible level, we need tech competition to bring about change
09:29:13 <erik_anderson> q+
09:29:15 <bryan> Dave_Birch: summing up; Gray established the merchant needs
09:29:26 <bryan> ... Robin suggested a web framework for this
09:29:40 <Zakim> Zakim has joined #w3cpayment
09:29:40 <bryan> ... Cyril suggested a standard way to move around the data
09:29:47 <wseltzer> q+ erik_anderson
09:30:24 <bryan> ... Joseph pointed out that we have collapsed unit of accounts, building upon other work
09:30:44 <bryan> ... Neil made the point that the medium of exchange needs to be extended into cash
09:30:57 <m4nu> q?
09:31:01 <chaals> usecase: allowing for a settlement that is based on a cash transfer
09:31:12 <jphong_> jphong_ has joined #w3cpayment
09:31:14 <bryan> ... e.e. walmart has a capability to buy online and pay in cash

09:31:21 <marie> marie has joined #w3cpayment
09:31:35 <marie> q?
09:31:51 <bryan> Stephane_W3C: you make a good point re the notion of decoupling payment systems with intent of payment
09:32:03 <bryan> ... this is a critical point; we need layer separation;
09:32:22 <m4nu> q+ to ask about entry points for change being merchants (MCX, could we deploy web payments in fuel industry?)
09:32:43 <bryan> ... having an easy way for merchants to support multiple systems and a method for user to select...
09:33:42 <bryan> Dave_Birch: between the phone and a payment terminal, there is a lot of chance for complex options to take place; standards may need to address the complext negotiations that will occur
09:34:27 <bryan> Cyril: part of standards is to define the value chain of payments
09:36:02 <bryan> Gray: taking into account foreign exchange, what I care about in the end is what I will get charged for
09:36:17 <marie> q?
09:36:18 <bryan> ... quoting the final ticket price will let the user choose
09:37:18 <tobie__> q?
09:37:19 <steph> steph has joined #w3cpayment
09:37:25 <bryan> Michel: there's no breakout that makes it possible to know what cut was taken by whom;
09:37:58 <bryan> ... re transparency and seamlessness, they don't correlate; the more choices are offered, the more complex the UX
09:38:15 <bryan> Gray: customers will never read those screens

09:39:10 <bryan> Eric(Bloomberg): what about POS terminals, how to integrate what we come up with here
09:40:11 <bryan> Gray: fees added happen in the back office, not the POS. pricing queues at the POS are philosohically great, but impossible
09:40:38 <bryan> ... if we can present the final ticket across multiple vendors and give choice that would be great
09:40:59 <Jorg> Jorg has joined #W3Cpayment
09:41:11 <Jonny> Jonny has joined #w3cpayment
09:41:13 <bryan> ... our POS challenge is painting the screen as the user is using it; we have to keep it simple for the user
09:41:38 <bryan> ... moving the POS screen down to the phone, you can see exactly what's going on
09:42:05 <erik_anderson> usecase: Move the point of sales terminal off to the users mobile ?
09:42:06 <bryan> Cyril: need for customer choice may be based upon size of the transaction
09:42:39 <Angie> Angie has joined #w3cpayment
09:42:51 <bryan> s/Cyril/Michel/
09:44:02 <bryan> Cyril: is is possible to automate options at the POS, for POS with web-based presentation
09:45:52 <bryan> Dave: existing systems do limit us, so we mustn't limit our standards efforts to the existing card system, but look to more options, with the understanding that one implementation of the standard may ultimately be card-based
09:46:31 <bryan> Michel: should a standard be explicit about roles? would it be acceptable for intermediaries to propose components of price?
09:46:52 <phobeo> q+
09:47:00 <bryan> ... in multiple currency transactions, the intermediary does define components of price
09:47:45 <wseltzer>  ack m4nu
09:47:45 <Zakim> m4nu, you wanted to ask about entry points for change being merchants (MCX, could we deploy web payments in fuel industry?)
09:47:50 <marie> ack m4
09:48:18 <bryan> Manu: it's good to think past cards; who will be the early adopters? probably not the banks unless fees are preserved
09:48:32 <bryan> ... convincing consumers may also be difficult
09:48:42 <bryan> Dave: successful wallets are from retailers
09:49:22 <bryan> Manu: exactly; retailers will push this into the market; W3C will need to figure out how to work with them
09:49:32 <bryan> Dave: we do need to build those bridges
09:49:39 <Ori_Eisen> What is the problem we are trying to solve?
09:49:53 <marie> q+ emil
09:50:11 <bryan> Michel: if the banks are changing, they will change with the game also if the economics are right
09:52:07 <bryan> Dave: banks also have an interest in driving down costs
09:53:03 <bryan> Gray: the limus test for retailers will be can they get banks to change from the interbank model
09:53:34 <bryan> ... retailers want online and POS to work the same
09:54:03 <m4nu> ACTION: Manu to reach out to MCX to try and get them involved in the W3C work on payments.
09:54:13 <bryan> Dave: retailers will incentivize customers to opt for MCX
09:54:17 <bryan> (what is MCX?)

09:55:08 <marie> zakim, close the queue
09:55:08 <Zakim> ok, marie, the speaker queue is closed
09:55:21 <bryan> Ernesto: re the point about negotiation on the payment process, users may need to choose manually since you can't always know what balances are on the different payment methods
09:55:43 <bryan> ... availability of options will also depend upon location
09:56:26 <bryan> Dave: what I am saying is there can be a wider set of possibilities
09:56:38 <virginie> note MCX : http://www.mcx.com/
09:57:09 <bryan> Ernesto: range of payment service providers can be loaded into the wallet in the short term, but balances may not be known
09:57:36 <bryan> ... user behavior/preferences can also drive automated choices
09:58:03 <ernesto> q?
09:58:20 <bryan> Dave: policies can be set and downloaded from many sources and executed at the POS
09:58:27 <steph> zakim, close queue
09:58:27 <Zakim> ok, steph, the speaker queue is closed
09:58:38 <bryan> Tobie: this is typically where user agents compete

09:59:48 <bryan> Ricardo: API integrations in browsers will likely cause Visa/MC to cooperate; so we shouldn't expect them to resist this. The standards won't say anything about fees so that will change on its own
10:00:27 <bryan> ... is we assume that we have to tell intermediaries what they have to do we are already making some assumptions
10:00:57 <bryan> Michel: what I was saying was that the role that intermediaries are taking needs to be visible in the standard
10:01:49 <bryan> Ricardo: there you are already supposing there will be intermediaries, and how many there are is unclear

10:02:43 <bryan> Emil: question re SEPAmail; trust is important, what will be the consumer protections?
10:04:31 <bryan> Cyril: consumer protection will be provided by the TTPP; the payload will define terms etc; the payment request will have all the data, the idea is to have all the info at the customer side so they can make decisions
10:04:46 <jameslei> jameslei has joined #W3Cpayment
10:05:20 <bryan> Dave: under the current systems, these aspects are all bundled. A system like SEPAmail will allow unbundling of those elements, which can then become part of a negotiation.
10:05:59 <bryan> ... Specialist Intermediaries may arise who can provide that role; Visa/MC may actually fulfill that role
10:06:44 <bryan> Alexander(EC): we have draft legislation that payer should have the final word on which payment service should be used
