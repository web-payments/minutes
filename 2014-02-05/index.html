<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: Updating Website w/ Charter and Work Items</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Feb/0001.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Feb/0001.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The voting is complete, we had a decent turnout, typical turnout for small w3c items is 0.5-1%, for larger votes its around 25%, we had 19% - so, that&apos;s good.</div>
<div class="information">David I. Lehn is scribing.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Results of charter vote were good, we now have a charter. 19% show up rate for charter. Good turnout.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Not much is going to change about how we operate (because the charter formalizes what we&apos;ve been doing for the past several years) but we have the charter written down now.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Posted charter on community page - <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/charter/">http://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/charter/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Two editorial changes. Wrong link to community and business process. Link to SWIFT removed per discussion last week.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Each of the work item are listed in the charter now.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>: Manu Is talking w/ a few legal teams from large organizations and they will advise if there are any issues.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Of the work items, the HTTP Signature nonces had least support, which is not surprising. Everything else had good support.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We could draw a few conclusions based on how people voted and what the priorites are.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>: We Could conclude that higher number voting suggests priorities for workplan.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  The voting rate may suggest priority but also may indicate level of understanding of a topic.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yeah, we shouldn&apos;t read too much into the number wrt. votes having to do w/ priorities, it&apos;s just one input to the decision plan.</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Web Identity Updates</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-identity/">https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-identity/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We&apos;re working with another company that&apos;s part of the group to figure out how to include other information with an identity.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Web Identity works with OpenID or Persona, once you login, the login mechanism transmits the identifier</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Should be able to do login via OpenID or Persona and be able to go get more information about an identity.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Two primary things you want in an identity. Easy to use object. Things like name, phone number, citizenship status, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If a government has signed a identity or similar, need to have a mechanism to get this info. So, that&apos;s the second thing you want - to be able to get ahold of the assertions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Signatures in payments work on assets and listings were done by normalizing data and storing signature along with data.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Similar for identities, but with one small difference - Store data and assertions on the data.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Assertions from government or other authority. Data will be signed by that entity and signature included with assertion. Then the assertions will be merged with the identity object.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  The identity object will include all the information related to the identity and all the assertions related to that information.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We can use the JSON-LD flatten feature to get all the data together in an easy to use object.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  If you want to check particular data, you can go through list of assertions and find who signed a piece of data.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Here&apos;s an example of an identity: <a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-identity/#a-typical-identity">https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-identity/#a-typical-identity</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Changes we&apos;ll need to make - we&apos;ll add a property called &quot;assertion&quot; with an array of assertions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Each assertion will have a type such as NameAssertion, AddressAssertion, EmailAssertion, or PassportAssertion. It will also include something called an &quot;endorsement&quot;, that is the information on the identity that you&apos;re asserting.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The entire assertion will be signed. If government signs a digital passport, can use the email or web identity url. That ties assertion to identity.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Electronic passport would assert name, birtdate, country, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Here&apos;s an example of what this would look like in practice: <a href="https://gist.github.com/dlongley/8827309">https://gist.github.com/dlongley/8827309</a></div>
<div class="information">Discussion Related to the design of the assertion and endorsement object.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  The &apos;id&apos; in endorsement needs to be the identity id so the flatten process works.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Mozilla badges system ties data to email address, so I don&apos;t know if this will work for something like that.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  It&apos;s a bad idea to use an email because our email addresses change over time, we don&apos;t want to lose that data just because our email address changed.</div>
<div class="information">Discussion About issues with how much data to be in endorsements and how to avoid leaking too much data.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Evan Schwartz</span>:  Could you have the government sign each piece of the identity and then sign some kind of group object that links all of the fields they&apos;ve signed together?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don&apos;t think we need the group signed, because the JSON-LD flattening process takes care of collating the data together. The issue is with granularity, if you have a passport that signs your name, government ID, and birthday and a site asks for just your birthday, you don&apos;t want to give them all of your passport assertion information. You just want to give them information related to your birthday. So, the government is going to have to provide multiple assertions - one each for name, birthday, and government ID and one for all of that information bundled together plus a few other passport-specific details.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Website could request information, but person could decide to not send certain information, then website could decide if they want to continue</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Evan Schwartz</span>:  I do think we should go that way.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yes, put the onus on websites to break the chain.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  So, we need to clarify how assertions and endorsements are made in the spec based on this discussion.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Do we want non-signed assertions to be made?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  May not be useful and could pollute the data model.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  If a 3rd party wants to assert something you should provide proof you made the assertions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  People can make assertions about themselves, the assertion is assumed and doesn&apos;t have to be signed.</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: HTTP Signatures</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We pushed a new HTTP Signatures spec out last week: <a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/http-signatures/">https://web-payments.org/specs/source/http-signatures/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We got feedback from Julian, who is the editor of a ton of HTTP specs at IETF and really knows his stuff: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Feb/0018.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Feb/0018.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  And feedback from Mark, the Chair of the HTTP working group: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Feb/0019.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Feb/0019.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  These guys really know what they&apos;re doing so we need to make a number of the changes they&apos;ve asked for and respond to them sooner than later.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Let&apos;s Cover Julian&apos;s feedback first - <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Feb/0018.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Feb/0018.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Confused if we define a HTTP Authentication scheme. We want this to work for both client-to-server and server-to-client scenarios, so we may want to not use the Authentication scheme and define our own HTTP header.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Julian says that we should align with algorithm names. Unfortunately, IETF specs used different naming for algorithms. JOSE vs DKIM etc. I&apos;m going to ask Julian what should be used.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Headers param. request-line change to &quot;(request-line)&quot; can break current deployed code.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Should do something that works better with HTTP/2</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We might just have to specify how the header line is canonicalized</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Item 4 extensions - removing the section, we have a better way of doing extensions now in the spec.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Item 5 - point to a proper base 64 spec, going to do that.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Item 6 - field values, We want to avoid canonicalization. proxies might do strange things to headers. </div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Might be able to use x- headers as a work around for proxies, we might want to spec that.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Item 7 - point to digest spec, yep, we&apos;ll do that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Item 8 - error handling. how to handle multiple values. use last value wins?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Whenever multiple occurances not allowed, last wins, done.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Where to send feedback? just use web payments list? I think just use the web payments mailing list since it&apos;s not an official HTTP Auth WG item.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Fix cite and other misc issues</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  On to Mark&apos;s feedback, his email is here: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Feb/0019.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Feb/0019.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We want to change the name of the spec and make the editorial changes he is asking for.  We want to avoid canonicalization if we can, but may not be able to do that for the request line.  Regarding the 401 Unauthorized + WWW-Authenticate, we don&apos;t really want to provide that but I doubt the spec will make it through the process w/o it, so we might as well add it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Anything else we need to cover for this call?</div>
<div class="information">No Other business mentioned.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Thanks, we may not have call next week.</div>
