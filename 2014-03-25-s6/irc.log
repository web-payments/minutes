13:39:06 <jeff> jeff has joined #w3cpayment
13:39:09 <schuki> virginie: there have been many sessions which have mentioned security
13:39:25 <schuki> ... identity and privacy
13:39:33 <schuki> ... our panelists are going to talk about these stuff
13:40:28 <schuki> ... hannes will be talking about IETF, gmandyam from qualcomm, tim from microsoft talking about product choices in microsoft, greg will share deployments solutions related to security, stefan from ripple, and harry from w3c perspective
13:40:50 <schuki> virginie: hannes to the stage
13:41:04 <schuki> hannes: i work in the ietf and was asked to talk about identity management
13:41:48 <Jorg> Jorg has joined #W3Cpayment
13:41:48 <bmathis> bmathis has joined #W3Cpayment
13:41:51 <schuki> ... a few years ago there was a patent where linked in was asking for user/pw of email account
13:41:59 <schuki> ... this created many privacy / secuirty problems
13:42:10 <schuki> hannes: many companies worked on solving this
13:42:26 <mountie> what OATH stand for?
13:42:35 <schuki> hannes: many of us have noted the building block approach and use of these
13:42:58 <schuki> hannes: the original protocol for this was OAuth
13:43:11 <wseltzer> [OAuth is an authorization protocol, not an abbreviation]
13:43:22 <cyril> cyril has joined #W3Cpayment
13:43:33 <Danny> Danny has joined #W3CPayment
13:43:38 <schuki> hannes: there are many companies using this today, some are in the room, also many smaller companies using this
13:43:45 <schuki> slide [2]
13:44:08 <schuki> hannes: this is how we defined identity, could be ansything from user/pw to a rick set of attributes
13:44:29 <schuki> ... not just auth context, usually much more than that
13:44:48 <schuki> hannes: so how does OAuth work? It all starts with the user ('resource owner')
13:45:14 <m4nu> m4nu has joined #W3Cpayment
13:45:14 <schuki> ... he stores resources somewhere
13:45:35 <schuki> ... he/she wants to give access to this shared resoucre
13:46:11 <schuki> ... an auth server has control of access to this
13:46:18 <schuki> ... it grants this access
13:46:33 <schuki> ... and this uses tokens, it captures the consent you have given and gives the client access
13:47:06 <schuki> hannes: here is a typicaly diaglogue
13:47:10 <schuki> slide [3]
13:47:13 <schuki> slide [4]
13:47:22 <Bulent> Bulent has joined #W3Cpayment
13:47:28 <schuki> hannes: so the resource owner is the end user
13:47:48 <schuki> ... and this user wants to buy something on a website, the client will then play the role of a merchant
13:48:03 <schuki> ... the merchant then gets the access to withdraw the money from the users bank account
13:48:17 <Harish> Harish has joined #W3Cpayment
13:48:24 <schuki> ... this is not an abstract concept. You can find descriptions of what these companies have tried to do
13:48:28 <schuki> slide [5]
13:48:37 <mdadas> mdadas has joined #w3cpayment
13:48:38 <schuki> hannes: i was told visa japan uses this mechanism
13:48:44 <schuki> slide [6]
13:49:03 <schuki> hannes: those are proprietary extensions on top of those protocols
13:49:19 <schuki> ... but i think we made a good contribution to lower the password sharing of the old patterns
13:49:29 <schuki> ... and helps users reduce the usage of pws
13:49:35 <schuki> ... but we did notice challenges,
13:49:45 <schuki> ... the industry likes to be an 'identity provider'
13:50:03 <schuki> ... but not many want to be a reliant party
13:50:34 <schuki> hannes: some hardware reliance for security for example
13:50:45 <schuki> hannes: the mechanism we have come up with is a decentralised approach
13:50:54 <jpotvin> jpotvin has joined #W3Cpayment
13:51:04 <schuki> ... even still many companies decided to go with a small number of identity providers
13:51:23 <schuki> ... so it;s still hard to find a fully open approach to identity providers
13:51:32 <bryan> re high interest to be IdP, relying party = identity consumer; most companies want to be the producer instead, and not dependent upon external companies for their user IDs
13:51:54 <schuki> hannes: we also noted some companies who use oauth also use it because they want to be interoperable with other companies
13:52:09 <schuki> ... this can create lock-in
13:52:23 <schuki> ... we cannot force people with what they do in thier business decisions, but it is unfortunate
13:52:38 <schuki> hannes: e.g. facebook only allow you to login with them
13:52:50 <schuki> slide [7]
13:52:51 <bshambaugh> If I may ask, what is identity?
13:52:56 <bshambaugh> sorry..
13:53:07 <bshambaugh> for interrupting
13:53:23 <schuki> hannes: whitelisting, there are some business agreements which make it difficult to give everyone full open access
13:53:32 <jonny> jonny has joined #w3cpayment
13:53:38 <schuki> ... there is some groups like Open Identity Exchange which work on this
13:53:50 <schuki> ... the education industry is also good here
13:54:28 <schuki> hannes: in terms of security, some companies ignore our recommendations
13:54:38 <schuki> ... or shortcut it, and optimise it in another way
13:54:44 <Ori_Eisen> Ori_Eisen has joined #W3Cpayment
13:55:10 <schuki> hannes: with regards to privacy: consent management helped with privacy
13:55:16 <Ori_Eisen> Facebook will not allow others to authenticate for them, as they can not control the quality of the process
13:55:30 <marie> group
13:55:32 <Ori_Eisen> this is a fundamental issue, that can not be solved with technology
13:55:44 <schuki> hannes: the reliant party asks for so much data
13:55:58 <schuki> ... they can ask for the purpose of the application
13:56:06 <schuki> ... e.g. angry birds asks for location
13:56:23 <schuki> ... FCC may need to kick in to stop this happening, but we are limited in what we can do here
13:56:28 <bryan> dependence upon reliability of the IdP is one reason for reluctance to be a relying party
13:57:08 <schuki> hannes: how much data you have to share depends on so many aspects
13:57:15 <schuki> slide [8]
13:57:38 <schuki> hannes: here i have included a link to the openID Connect protocol
13:57:48 <schuki> ... thank-you

13:58:36 <ernesto> q- hannes
13:59:05 <schuki> Jorg: have you considered who owns the identity data or who owns it
13:59:13 <schuki> ... and who takes responsibility for it
13:59:34 <Emil> Emil has joined #W3Cpayment
13:59:35 <schuki> ... the stuff we're talking about here may be too technical, but these issues are real
13:59:39 <marie> q?
14:00:05 <schuki> hannes: sim based auth may be the way you want to do it, or a smart card
14:00:14 <schuki> ... we didn't standardise on this, it can be outsources
14:00:15 <m4nu> use case: Use OpenID Connect to bootstrap a payments process.
14:00:23 <schuki> s/outsources/outsourced
14:00:38 <schuki> hannes: also, how do you separate the identity and the person?
14:00:40 <bryan> as noted by Hannes, OAuth can be a basis for payment APIs such as the OMA Payment API: http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/release_program/docs/PaymentREST/V1_0-20130924-A/OMA-TS-REST_NetAPI_Payment-V1_0-20130924-A.pdf
14:01:24 <schuki> hannes: also te auth server and resource are separate components implemented by different implementers
14:01:33 <schuki> ... this makes a lot of sense
14:01:56 <marie> q?
14:02:03 <schuki> adrian: what is a payment protocol and how can it fit?
14:02:31 <schuki> hannes: the payment mechanisms on top of identity infrastructure already had the hooks to give the consent in the web and mobile app space
14:02:41 <schuki> ... all they did was create additional data structure
14:02:49 <schuki> s/structure/structures
14:03:14 <schuki> hannes: it might be a good starting point as what can be done with these mechanisms
14:03:28 <schuki> ... e.g. how you provide access from one payment system to a merchant
14:03:56 <bryan> as noted by Hannes, OAuth can be a basis for payment APIs such as the OMA Payment API: http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/release_program/docs/PaymentREST/V1_0-20130924-A/OMA-TS-REST_NetAPI_Payment-V1_0-20130924-A.pdf
14:04:10 <schuki> m4nu: we looked at openid connect and working on identity credentials spec
14:04:18 <bryan> Sorry for the repaste... bad client
14:04:44 <schuki> m4nu: seems like credential solution could work on storing credentials in some kind of cloud based identity
14:04:58 <schuki> ... and then have the ability to send the credentials in a very specific way
14:05:13 <schuki> ... for a payment you show up to a merchant and share your payment provider info
14:05:28 <schuki> ... it seems like we're heading to a system which manages all of this
14:05:44 <schuki> m4nu: have you seen anyone at IETF talk about the transmission of digitally verifiable credentials?1
14:06:00 <schuki> m4nu: oh, and requestAutoComplete does the same, shares certain details
14:06:05 <bryan> What Hannes is referring to re OpenID Connect use in payments is I think more specifically the use of OAuth (as a fundamental part of OpenID Connect) as a framework for defining the scope of a payment, as in the OMA Payment API I mentioned before.
14:06:24 <schuki> hannes: well, the access token that we have here between the client and protected resource is the credential
14:06:48 <schuki> ... what some of the industry players are working on are a higher security version of this
14:06:51 <schuki> ... currently uses TLS
14:07:10 <schuki> ... we are working on using a key or async credential
14:07:39 <schuki> ... in order for it to be sucessfully deployed it requires existance of standards that harry et al have been working on at W3c
14:08:08 <schuki> hannes: with todays browers this is tough, to store stuff in localstorage
14:08:18 <schuki> ... so we have to work on something which is more secure
14:08:28 <schuki> ... so we are hoping W3C crypto work is getting there
14:09:03 <schuki> hannes: we are getting closer to deploying this secure version
14:10:08 <schuki> mountie: we have seen openid, these kind of mechanisms touching for identity, do we think multiple provider (payment, identity, FX etc) we have this idea of expansion
14:10:19 <schuki> ... will there be a gateway?
14:10:24 <bryan> OpenID Connect is also being used in the GSMA Mobile Connect API program http://gsmamobileeconomy.com/gsmamc/ as another example of how secure/trusted identity can be seamlessly integrated into mobile services, based upon OpenID.
14:10:33 <schuki> hannes: we didn't look much at multiple sources, but people have explored this
14:10:55 <schuki> ... telecomms people have looked at attribute provider (e.g. street address info as well as subscriber data)
14:11:11 <schuki> ... provider has the ability to verify against this data
14:11:17 <m4nu> Identity Credentials spec: https://web-payments.org/specs/source/identity-credentials/
14:11:31 <schuki> ... idea was that there will be some sort of broker which would make it available to the user
14:11:40 <m4nu> A Proposal for Credential-based Login: http://manu.sporny.org/2014/credential-based-login/
14:11:50 <schuki> mountie: with the payment provider we don't exchange info cross site, just with provider only
14:12:00 <schuki> ... so address is given to delivery provider only
14:12:12 <m4nu> (that is related to the comment about OpenID Connect, storage of credentials online, etc. above)
14:12:14 <schuki> ... possible?
14:12:23 <schuki> hannes: nothing we have done so far
14:12:56 <schuki> virginie: let's welcome tim from microsoft to the stage
14:12:58 <Danny> Danny has joined #W3CPayment
14:13:09 <schuki> slide [1]
14:13:25 <schuki> tim: i work on the commerce team at microsoft
14:13:30 <schuki> slide [2]
14:13:40 <jonny> jonny has joined #w3cpayment
14:13:45 <schuki> tim: our thoughts around identty
14:13:46 <lesellier> lesellier has joined #w3cpayment
14:14:10 <schuki> ... as a result of living in multiple countries i have many bank accounts
14:14:19 <schuki> s/identty/identity
14:14:33 <schuki> tim: I also have many social network accounts
14:14:43 <schuki> ... i tend to separate with who i interact with
14:15:18 <schuki> ... I also have an address and I went to school and am recognised against these
14:15:33 <schuki> ... these are all things used to find me
14:15:49 <schuki> tim: so we decided at microsoft that we didn't want to launch a new commerce identity
14:15:59 <schuki> ... we didn't want you to give more info over
14:16:13 <schuki> ... so you take something that identifies you with a commerce identity
14:16:15 <erik_anderson> erik_anderson has joined #w3cpayment
14:16:16 <schuki> slide [3]
14:16:40 <schuki> ...this identity identifies you next to these identities
14:16:48 <schuki> ... whatever you created it links to your financial data
14:16:48 <wseltzer> q+ to ask what about customers who don't want a *single* commerce identity but multiple personalities?
14:17:09 <schuki> ... it realted you to rights, you may have purchases an xbox game
14:17:19 <m4nu> q-
14:17:20 <schuki> ... or whatever,
14:17:24 <m4nu> q- mountie
14:17:33 <schuki> ... you have a right to the game, but you may not have paid for it
14:17:43 <schuki> ... you mum might have bought it for you
14:17:58 <schuki> tim: we also model things against your 'friends'
14:18:18 <schuki> ... this could help you give access to some friends so they can access things you have license for
14:18:28 <schuki> tim: we model both buyers and sellers
14:18:46 <schuki> ... so from a commerece perpective we see what is bought and sold
14:18:58 <schuki> ... we have all the info on your purchase history
14:19:04 <schuki> ... we give a score for this
14:19:16 <schuki> tim: we want these commerce accounts to be stored offline and online
14:19:33 <schuki> ... we want you to get a statement at the end of the month as to what you bought
14:19:51 <schuki> tim: finally we give you the ability to enter multiple payment options and rules
14:20:03 <schuki> ... there are simple rules (50/50 between two created cards)
14:20:14 <schuki> ... rules can be complicated
14:20:24 <schuki> s/created/credit
14:20:39 <schuki> tim: the commerce identity is separate from your google/yahoo/hotmail
14:21:03 <schuki> tim: we are trying to find out how users can get a commerce account for those who don't have an online profile
14:21:10 <schuki> ... say if user first goes to a store
14:21:20 <schuki> ... so can we use credit card or passport as in ID?
14:21:25 <schuki> slide 4]
14:21:43 <schuki> tim: there are a lot of identity providers here
14:22:03 <schuki> ... we use the oauth protocol to integrate these
14:22:14 <schuki> ... we use different views
14:22:28 <schuki> ... so if you login with your corporate account you get a different view
14:22:58 <schuki> tim: modelling trust between commerce accounts: so you don't give credit card to merchant
14:23:19 <wseltzer> q+ re strong privacy guarantees, if you do link information?
14:23:24 <schuki> ... also limiting spending limits for family members
14:23:43 <schuki> tim: what we have done is only for microsoft products
14:23:49 <schuki> ... we want to extend thios
14:23:53 <schuki> s/thios/this
14:23:59 <m4nu> q?
14:24:03 <schuki> ... this is a opportunity for partnerships
14:24:13 <schuki> tim: we want to bridge physical and digital worlds
14:24:20 <schuki> ... also fraud
14:24:25 <schuki> ... fraud is very siloed
14:24:37 <jeff> q+
14:24:53 <schuki> ... there is some interesting things to research here
14:24:59 <schuki> slide [5]
14:25:11 <m4nu> use case: Associate fraud information with identities.
14:25:25 <schuki> security, we want to establish a secure protocol
14:25:26 <kodonog> kodonog has joined #w3cpayment
14:25:44 <schuki> tim: we may look at some money transfer scenarios
14:25:45 <m4nu> use case: Don't share any theft-worthy data with merchants.
14:25:56 <schuki> ... we are looking at new flows here
14:26:08 <schuki> ... we would like the same API to work across situations
14:26:25 <schuki> tim: we have some issues with security across banks and providers
14:26:36 <schuki> ... ACH is good but hard, we want to work with this
14:27:05 <schuki> ... I'd like to see more encryption in this whole pipeline
14:27:23 <schuki> tim: we'd like to increase interoperability, discover where in the stack these solutions can help
14:27:26 <Ori_Eisen> you cant easily change the 8583 protocol as millions of legacy systems will need to be changed
14:27:28 <schuki> ... thank-you
14:27:39 <m4nu> q?
14:27:49 <wseltzer> ack wseltzer
14:27:49 <Zakim> wseltzer, you wanted to ask what about customers who don't want a *single* commerce identity but multiple personalities? and to discuss strong privacy guarantees, if you do link
14:27:49 <schuki> virginie: just one question from wendy, then wait till the end of all the speakers
14:27:52 <Zakim> ... information?
14:28:35 <schuki> wseltzer: thanks for sharing tim, what privacy considerations could you offer to user who doesn't want a single identity? Or who only wants to make payment but not to anything else
14:29:08 <schuki> tim: good q. Today we allow user to create commerce account and not link org to that identity, and then you can create another account
14:29:33 <schuki> ... then we wouldn't know the accounts were linked
14:29:34 <jeff> q-
14:29:44 <schuki> virginie: next is stefan from ripple
14:30:28 <schuki> stefan: i will talk about identity from decentralised networks POV
14:30:30 <schuki> slide [1]
14:30:43 <schuki> and how distribute networks can help the issues speakers have bought up
14:30:45 <schuki> slide [2]
14:30:47 <Danny_> Danny_ has joined #W3CPayment
14:30:53 <schuki> stefan: definition of terms
14:31:03 <schuki> slide [3]
14:31:19 <m4nu> Use Case: Place identity in a decentralized network
14:31:41 <schuki> stefan: authentication (identifier could be name, or anything), attestation
14:32:10 <schuki> ... (providing better solutions for trust)
14:32:32 <cyberphone> cyberphone has joined #W3Cpayment
14:32:43 <schuki> stefan: as a payments WG we would not presume to be more knowledgable on identiy, but look at some of the unique challenges for identity and payment
14:32:56 <schuki> ... and how these distributed networks can help here
14:33:00 <schuki> ... or be impacted
14:33:04 <schuki> slide [4]
14:33:19 <schuki> stefan: you have many identities (work, home, gamer id)
14:33:38 <schuki> slide [5]
14:34:03 <schuki> stefan: with your identity you can have claims and orgs requesting claims
14:34:08 <schuki> slide [6]
14:34:18 <schuki> stefan: openid connect is pretty good, agnostic to provider
14:34:39 <schuki> ... cryptographically secure
14:34:49 <schuki> .. offers granularity
14:34:54 <schuki> s/../...
14:35:03 <schuki> ... supports discovery
14:35:11 <schuki> slide [7]
14:35:28 <schuki> stefan: why would you care if google are your provider?
14:35:33 <schuki> ... they are a target, so you might care
14:35:53 <schuki> stefan: also there is a lot of lockin for some providers
14:36:18 <schuki> ... it's hard to capture this point, but ppl do think there should be a different way
14:36:21 <schuki> slide [8]
14:36:48 <schuki> stefan: openid is another option
14:37:08 <schuki> stefan: in ripple, we take a pw, we blind it, we take the unblinded value as a key
14:37:30 <schuki> ... have full benefits of identity provider and 2 factor auth
14:37:33 <schuki> slide [9]
14:37:43 <schuki> the other problem is switching providers
14:38:08 <schuki> stefan: a global identifier could help here
14:38:14 <schuki> ... so Alice can sign things that act on her behalf
14:38:29 <schuki> ... this is independant of any company
14:38:40 <schuki> stefan: so how do i pay Alice?
14:38:53 <schuki> ... we have a mapping from Alice to global pay identifier
14:39:14 <schuki> ... and from there you map to different ways you can pay Alice
14:39:24 <schuki> ... e.g. bank account, or bitcoin wallet
14:39:39 <Ori_Eisen> How do you know for sure it is Alice who provided the crednetials?
14:39:44 <schuki> ... this is an early version of what a web payments group could come up with
14:39:53 <schuki> slide [10]
14:40:02 <m4nu> Use Case: Update identity information in a decentralized network (replace payment providers, etc.)
14:40:03 <schuki> stefan: so where is this info stored?
14:40:49 <schuki> ... we want claims to not be stored in any particular info
14:41:06 <schuki> s/info/place
14:41:33 <schuki> stefan: so we can store these pieces of information decentrally
14:41:44 <schuki> ... thank-you
14:42:03 <schuki> virginie: gmandyam is our next speaker
14:42:34 <chaals> [Agree with ernesto, relying on reputation provides a barrier to entry...]
14:42:55 <schuki> gmandyam: thank-you to the organisers
14:43:08 <schuki> ... i run web standards in qualcomm
14:43:16 <schuki> ... with QuIC
14:43:24 <schuki> s/with/withi
14:43:33 <schuki> s/withi/within
14:43:49 <jpotvin> q+
14:43:55 <schuki> gmandyam: we have been doing more in the mobile payments given the hardware that has come into play
14:44:01 <schuki> slide [2]
14:45:00 <schuki> gmandyam: some history, lots of work in premium sms
14:45:08 <schuki> ... this is still growing!
14:45:13 <schuki> ... not going to die soon
14:45:18 <m4nu> q?
14:45:48 <schuki> gmandyam: any soltuon will have to look into how premium sms fits into the open web
14:46:39 <schuki> gmandyam: it's not a great solution, bad rev shares, need to eat the bad debt, etc.
14:46:45 <schuki> slide [3]
14:47:05 <ernesto> q?
14:47:19 <schuki> gmandyam: header enrichment, this is actually a very workable and used method
14:47:34 <schuki> ... msisdn is injected into the header in the operator proxy
14:47:45 <schuki> ... user never knows payment doens't take place
14:47:53 <schuki> ... but it's not as secure
14:48:25 <Emil> Emil has joined #W3Cpayment
14:48:33 <schuki> gmandyam: once your outside the network then the operator doesn't know what you're doing
14:49:03 <schuki> gmandyam: standards could help by setting guidelines
14:49:19 <schuki> slide [4]
14:49:36 <schuki> we are seeing more use of contextual data (geo location etc)
14:50:04 <schuki> gmandyam: we did a lot of research on mobile shopping, particularly germany
14:50:38 <schuki> ... in grocery they scan items and present final barcode and then leave the store
14:50:38 <phobeo> q?
14:50:58 <schuki> ... this was ok, but why can't we use indoor location to tell when they left
14:51:13 <schuki> ... bluetooth access points was not great for indoor location tracking
14:51:38 <schuki> .. i reason was couldn't keep up with speeds
14:51:43 <schuki> ... beacons might help here
14:51:45 <phobeo> q+
14:52:08 <schuki> gmandyam: user should just be able to walk out.
14:52:19 <schuki> ... and purchase should happen
14:52:28 <schuki> gmandyam: HTML5 has given us some helpful APIs here
14:52:36 <schuki> ... it could help with multifactor auth too
14:52:55 <wseltzer> [note: privacy in contextual information]
14:53:05 <schuki> gmandyam: security is still an issue
14:53:13 <schuki> ... even TLS has security holes
14:53:38 <erik_anderson_> erik_anderson_ has joined #w3cpayment
14:53:54 <schuki> ... WebRTC has some issues here with emergency calls, biometric data has issues too
14:53:59 <schuki> ... re trust in browser and TLS
14:54:10 <erik_anderson_> erik_anderson_ has joined #w3cpayment
14:54:34 <schuki> gmandyam: EME spec is a bit of a blackbox, so we are getting comfortable with more secure models
14:54:38 <schuki> ... thank-you
14:54:41 <erik_anderson_> W3C needs to reference some 3rd party secure hardware
14:54:58 <schuki> virginie: next speaker is gregory fhe lira network
14:55:16 <erik_anderson_> Google and Yubico have been working together on the U2F spec (universal 2 factor)
14:55:48 <schuki> s/lira/lyra
14:56:04 <schuki> gregory: here we will talk about principles
14:56:10 <schuki> slide [2]
14:56:23 <schuki> we have been conerned with centralised systems and data leaks
14:56:33 <schuki> ... or surviellance
14:57:14 <schuki> gregory: there was some expression to centralise the wbe
14:57:18 <schuki> s/wbe/web
14:57:20 <erik_anderson_> ernesto: http://www.yubico.com/2013/03/future-of-authentication-faq/
14:57:33 <erik_anderson_> ernesto: www.getnymi.com
14:58:18 <schuki> gregory: there have been platforms that are more decntralised
14:58:21 <schuki> slide [3]
14:58:29 <schuki> gregory: there is a lot of innovation in hardware
14:59:20 <schuki> ... but not just hardware, some innovations are listed here
14:59:24 <erik_anderson_> Facebook and Google have been working with Yubico on a hardware solution to remove passwords
14:59:28 <schuki> ... secure elements, nfc, biometrics...
14:59:50 <jonny> jonny has joined #w3cpayment
15:00:28 <schuki> ... FIDO, identity credentials
15:00:35 <cyberphone> http://images.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iOS_Security_Feb14.pdf
15:00:49 <schuki> ... some issues need to be addressed
15:00:54 <schuki> ... ease of use
15:01:20 <schuki> ... related to data aggregation
15:02:23 <schuki> gregory: currently easy to copy data between devices, this is difficult to trust
15:02:26 <erik_anderson_> m4nu I have been following this industry for a while.  I cant kill the evil anonymous until it is nearly impossible to impersonate someone
15:02:51 <schuki> ... so many devices could produce multiple points of failure
15:03:13 <schuki> gregory: identity and privacy is different, what you are is what other orgs know about you
15:03:41 <erik_anderson_> schuki - Nearly impossible to coordinate a remote attack across multiple devices
15:03:44 <schuki> ... identity is being someone
15:04:08 <schuki> ... trust, trust is a subjective idea
15:04:13 <schuki> ... we talked about cryptography
15:04:30 <schuki> ... you can have trust in something / someone without sharing keys / credentials
15:04:54 <schuki> slide [4]
15:05:41 <schuki> gregory: idea is to build your own web of trust
15:05:58 <schuki> ... you can add your id card, it can be part of your web of trust
15:06:16 <schuki> ... you have to do the choice
15:06:21 <schuki> ... also about education
15:06:33 <schuki> ... facebook have done something for 1/2 years re trusted contacts
15:06:41 <schuki> gregory: not everyone is web savvy
15:06:48 <schuki> ... anyone could fall into the trap
15:07:10 <schuki> ... you should put people who act as an insurance for you in case someone puts something which is wrong for your service
15:07:52 <m4nu> Use Case: Figure out a way to couple identities together to allow one identity to retrieve access to another identity if the 2nd identity loses their 2FA device.
15:08:24 <bryan> usecase: keeping your web of trust in your wallet
15:08:46 <schuki> ... there needs to be a balance of things you need to give to the merchant and not
15:08:54 <schuki> slide [5]
15:09:01 <erik_anderson_> Manu: most providers allow you to setup multiple 2FA devices for your account incase you loose a device
15:09:10 <schuki> gregory: secret sharing: idea is to avoid the point of failure
15:09:24 <virginie> note shamir's reference : http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/
15:09:25 <erik_anderson_> 1 on person, 1 in fire safety box
15:09:30 <schuki> ... you don't store your credentials in one place but in many palces
15:09:36 <schuki> s/palces/places
15:10:24 <m4nu> Shamir's secret is considered bad security practice via Bitcoin community - which is why they did multi-sig (in a way that wasn't Shamir's secret)
15:10:33 <erik_anderson_> Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme is less effective than multiple key signature protocols
15:10:57 <erik_anderson_> +1 Manu!!!
15:10:59 <schuki> gregory: internet of things: could argue the object owns, rather than other way around
15:11:31 <schuki> ... object can become part of your identity
15:12:33 <schuki> gregory: thank-you
15:12:43 <bryan> usecase: secure backup storage of wallet info a friends wallet
15:13:06 <schuki> virginie: we have discussed open id, protocols, security features, better management of identity
15:13:06 <dka> q?

15:13:25 <Jorg> Jorg has joined #W3Cpayment
15:14:00 <schuki> harry: there are a number of things going wrong
15:14:14 <schuki> ... there is a number of things W3C can do, and one of those is web crypto API
15:14:18 <jonny> jonny has joined #w3cpayment
15:14:35 <schuki> harry: up to a few months ago it was very hard to check digital signatures
15:15:08 <schuki> ... this was because those components which were needed for secure applications were not available in the JS runtime
15:15:14 <chaals> [I still rely on a lot of real life social networks for authentication - e.g. in bankingâ€¦]
15:15:15 <schuki> ... workshop ran some time ago
15:15:43 <schuki> harry: we can build technical systems that can build secure systems
15:16:03 <schuki> ... and the great success over the past few years is oauth
15:16:09 <schuki> ... persona came about a few years
15:16:14 <schuki> ... dying now
15:16:39 <schuki> ... but at the same point whilst this was going on the auth stuff was happening
15:17:11 <erik_anderson_> Chaals: Go buy a 3D printer!!!
15:17:18 <schuki> ... and now we have the crypto group (lists participants) which are unified on an API
15:17:40 <virginie> note : Web Crypto API https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcrypto-api/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html
15:17:49 <schuki> harry: so you need to know who has the private key material
15:18:25 <schuki> ... right now the crypto API doesn't allow you to do that
15:18:45 <schuki> ... but now we;re working with some new groups: FIDO alliance et al
15:18:55 <schuki> ... so we can get hardware tokens working for the browser
15:19:49 <schuki> ... we're inspecting key storage stuff in browser, new crypto works by some other groups, working with IETF
15:20:10 <schuki> ... working with all these people to develop crypto API and hardware token
15:20:40 <schuki> harry: pretty sure hardware tokens will have a workshop in sept in silicon valley
15:20:48 <schuki> ... so join the crypto group
15:21:09 <dsr> s/sept/September 2014/
15:22:04 <schuki> ... and help us take these implementations to the community so we can discuss them all together
15:22:09 <schuki> ... thank-you
15:22:20 <schuki> virginie: thanks for the good work in the crypto group harry
15:22:38 <schuki> ... next is Louise
15:22:53 <schuki> louise: identity is marred with trust
15:23:03 <schuki> louise: trust is essential for online payments
15:23:09 <bryan> s/marred/married/
15:23:28 <schuki> ... standards for payments on the internet is linked with security, tracability, privacy and anonymity
15:24:40 <schuki> louise: you have to get the right data at the right place at the right time, so you need to be certain for some use that the identifier is linked to what you are concerned with
15:24:59 <schuki> ... since people and orgs are not attached to the internet
15:25:16 <schuki> ... how do you know they are linked on the internet
15:26:18 <schuki> louise: how certain you need to be that it is me or my company that is needing the thing is where we come into risk in the internet
15:26:48 <schuki> ... in the virtual world you may want to know you're dealing with me by many levels of
15:26:55 <schuki> s/of/
15:27:48 <schuki> louise:  in banking transactions the only thing that matter is i opened the account and i am deposting the money
15:27:55 <schuki> ... but there exists legislation
15:28:30 <schuki> louise: will web paymetns come under jurisdiction?
15:28:54 <schuki> ... I predict p2p payments will start to become regulated
15:28:58 <Angie> Angie has joined #w3cpayment
15:29:00 <schuki> ...this will of course have impacts
15:29:14 <schuki> louise: should you have one or many identities
15:29:59 <schuki> ... most people think you should be allowed to have many identities
15:30:18 <schuki> ... associated with ppl or orgs
15:30:43 <schuki> ... there are terms and conditions assoicated for each
15:30:57 <Danny_> Danny_ has joined #W3CPayment
15:30:58 <schuki> louise:  some people think IPv6 is the answer to the issues with identity
15:31:03 <schuki> ... i think that's a non starter
15:31:35 <schuki> ... korean govt could access all identities, but this became unconstitutional
15:31:58 <schuki> louise: in online commerce you need to be able to provie you've made the transaction
15:32:25 <schuki> ... i like the allipay escrow model
15:32:53 <schuki> ... in many online / international dealing you need a third party
15:33:00 <chaals> s/could access all/mandated that access to korean sites would only be available to those who had government-verified/
15:33:52 <chaals> s/became uncon/was later ruled to be uncon/
15:33:52 <erik_anderson_> For public record Anonymity is evil!!!
15:33:55 <schuki> louise: i would say anonymity is not evil, people can hide behind it an do evil things, but it doesn't make anonymity evil
15:33:56 <erik_anderson_> :)
15:34:33 <schuki> louise: privacy is about only providing data to those you want to provide it
15:34:46 <bryan> privacy is also the right to share what you want to share - seems like the same thing as protecting what you want, but it isnt
15:35:03 <schuki> ... advocates of privacy are trying to protect the individual
15:35:14 <chaals> [I wonder if privacy is about providing data, and a sense of what you think it is OK to do with that data]
15:35:46 <bryan> +1 chaals - putting people in control of their data is privacy
15:35:48 <schuki> louise: de-anonymisation is much more damaging then anonymity
15:36:19 <schuki> ... seems some people didn't want anonymity, they wanted non-tracability
15:36:28 <schuki> ...some people wanted to hide from the authorities
15:36:44 <schuki> ...they didn't want to hide from friends, just not tracable from the state
15:37:24 <schuki> louise: many of us achieve this by using the different identities
15:38:28 <m4nu> Loving this talk - really great capture of the subleties of privacy/anonymity/security/traceability.
15:38:38 <schuki> louise: freedom of speech is far more important than privacy
15:38:45 <erik_anderson_> usecase: separate the idea of privacy and anonymity when it comes to web payments.  Privacy for online actions is important.  Anonymity when it comes to financial transactions and moving of money is evil
15:38:53 <jpotvin> US freedom to > freedom from; EU freedom from > freedom to
15:38:59 <schuki> ... you must address these issues otherwise standards will have no global validity
15:39:00 <jonny> jonny has joined #w3cpayment
15:39:12 <mountie> q?
15:39:13 <schuki> virginie: i would like to thank the speakers
15:39:33 <chaals> usecase: completely banishing the word "evil"
15:40:08 <schuki> virginie: we covered the multiple identity issue, user control over their info, protocols and how to make them secure, education
15:40:39 <schuki> virginie: please ask questions to the speaker in the break
15:41:22 <chaals> [I'm not sure that we want to draw the lines on what is privacy and anonymity. But I think standards need to support transparency of understanding what will happen to information (money, correspondence, associations, â€¦)]
