<div class="information">Dave Longley is scribing.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Agenda today is covering Andrei&apos;s progress, some discussion about upcoming conferences about web payments, spec updates, browser payments single-click purchasing.</div>
<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: Update on GSoC Student Progress</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Andrei Oprea</span>:  currently i&apos;m trying to purchases available in my marketplace example, you can make listings but i&apos;ve run into some problems that i&apos;m trying to fix with purchases</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Andrei Oprea</span>:  afterwards i&apos;d like to focus on more options like reselling (make that available in the marketplace)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Andrei Oprea</span>:  and add validation for the data because currently anything typed in is accepted</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we&apos;ve been trying to help with issues on IRC ... is there anything else you want to cover on the call today?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Andrei Oprea</span>:  one question i have is about the listing ... it has fields like &quot;destination&quot; and &quot;payee&quot; and all of those aren&apos;t quite clear to me</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Andrei Oprea</span>:  there are identities that you have to fill in</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Andrei Oprea</span>:  so.. destination is where the money is going, who is going to receive the money</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  yes, that&apos;s correct, if a purchase occurs that&apos;s where the money should go</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Andrei Oprea</span>:  is the vendor is marketplace or the person who created the asset/is selling it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it can be either, it depends on the use case, for a large music provider they might allow fans to sell their music but for each sale they want 80% of the sale, sony would create the asset and describe some restrictions there, but a fan could then list (create a listing for the asset) on their blog and talk about it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and in this case the assetProvider would be the music provider (eg: Sony) and vendor would be the fan selling</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Before we go further, I want to clarify - the vendor is going to be the marketplace in your use case. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  The use cases Manu just described probably don&apos;t apply to you. If you want to make assets in the marketplace available for sale on other websites, you can do that, but the vendor would have to sign that listing, not the marketplace. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Andrei Oprea</span>:  so my last question was about the assetHash/licenseHash</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  What is the license hash? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  In PaySwarm, since you&apos;re putting things out on the Web, when you retrieve the URL you might get content back that&apos;s different from day to day. In order to deal with that problem, we hash the contents to make sure that the contents are what are expected. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  The license hash is a hash of all of the data about the license. So if someone goes out and retrieves all of the information, the PA will go out and check to make sure the hash is the same thing. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We have to ensure that everyone in this process sees the same license. It&apos;s a way of verifying that the information has not changed. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Andrei asked how the hash is generated. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  The license page has to have a syntax that can be converted into RDF - either JSON-LD or RDFa right now. We retrieve all of the information from a web page, we normalize the RDF, and the stream of bytes is sent through a hashing algorithm. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  You can put a license up as RDFa or JSON-LD, either one. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There is a utility in payswarm.js that helps you generate hashes. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  You can just use the API calls to generate a hash, and there is a tool that can give you the hash bundled with payswarm.js. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Travis Choma</span>: hi guys, was stuck in traffic. dialed in now.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  kumar have you guys dealt with associating licenses with purchases, etc?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  we don&apos;t have anything like that specified, it&apos;s up to the app that does the sale right now</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  so an app will get a receipt to make sure something was paid for, but it&apos;s all in their hands to manage [licenses, etc]</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Conference Presentations for Web Payments</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so the first conference will be Inside Bitcoins: <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/insidebitcoins/">http://www.mediabistro.com/insidebitcoins/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so we&apos;re going to talk about how the browser payments API and the payswarm protocol will be used to support bitcoin</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i&apos;m going to try and recruit folks there, we&apos;re going to have some core bitcoin software developers there and we&apos;re going to try to get them involved in this group so we can get some inputs on how to process bitcoin payments so we can talk about how to properly do it in the browser.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the other thing that might come out of this is that payswarm is currency agnostic and bitcoin is one of the features that&apos;s next on our timeline (hopefully within the next year) and we want to get people involved from that community</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  kumar, anything w/respect to mozilla you&apos;d like me to mention?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  i&apos;d like to know if it would be possible to use navigator.mozPay() to do a bitcoin purchase without any intermediate server whatsoever</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  i know there are ways to generate a bitcoin wallet in JS (generate the keys on the client, etc) but i don&apos;t know about sending the payment to another party, i think there needs to be servers involved somewhere, but it would be cool if not</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the biggest thing working against bitcoin payments like that is the time it takes to verify payments on the network (it can take up to 30-90 minutes), so the idea that you can get instant access to stuff is kinda shaky</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  but new services are providing short term credits to people so that people can buy things instantaneously online without the transaction going through immediately</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and that&apos;s kind of the way payswarm was going to work with bitcoin here -- the biggest blocker is that you can&apos;t get a receipt back immediately, you have to wait for stuff to get integrated into the blockchain</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  but i&apos;d like to be able to say mozilla&apos;s really interested in getting this to work so who can we work with, who is interested in joining us to make this happen</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Travis Choma</span>:  if we can find a proof of concept that makes sense for the minimal use case that would be great, i&apos;m sure we can find some resources as mozilla to help out too</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  with payswarm the vendor could sign something and give it back to you and you could submit it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there are a lot of offline use cases in payswarm that could apply here to bitcoin as well</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Travis Choma</span>:  is the 30-90 minute window a fixed window?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it&apos;s been increasing because the number of txns has been going up, it depends on the number of txns on the network/hashes to verify/etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there are fees you can pay to move things into a block that&apos;s sooner vs. later, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  most importantly, it&apos;s probably not ever going to go down below 10 minutes, at least that&apos;s what a lot of people think</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  unless you allow the miners to take high fees out of the txn</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there are all kinds of trade offs when dealing with bitcoins, but the idea that it would be instantaneous won&apos;t work with the traditional model (there are some forks trying to work on this)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if you trust the entity doing the purchase you can always essentially extend credit for that period of time</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  but i dont&apos; see people like NYT, apple, larger companies taking on that much risk, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so that&apos;s inside bitcoin, and i&apos;ll tell them we really want to work with them to make browser bitcoin work</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  next is SIBOS 2013: <a href="http://www.sibos.com/sibos_2013_dubai.page">http://www.sibos.com/sibos_2013_dubai.page</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this is when all the member banking companies involved with swift meet up</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i&apos;m giving 5 talks, one on financial standards, i&apos;ll be talking about payswarm, mozPay, JSON-LD and data about financial info, and how all this changes the way people deal with money, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and tchoma, kumar, you want me to reach out the same way there?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  yeah, i think so</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  if there&apos;s anyone that wants to work on the spec that would be a good place to pitch that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there&apos;s a workshop too, some of that has to do with payments in the browser, i&apos;m trying to get 30-60 minutes and maybe get someone from mozilla there</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i&apos;ve arranged so that it would be paid for, but it&apos;s more of a time thing</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it&apos;s in dubai, so it&apos;s kinda a long trip</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Travis Choma</span>:  we can discuss offline, sure</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  there&apos;s an email floating around but no definitive responses yet</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  after that are a couple of talks in LA</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  mostly the same approach about payswarm mozPay, etc. payments in browser -- come join us if interested</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  then the united nations internet goverence forum: <a href="http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/aboutigf">http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/aboutigf</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  they are interested in IP dissemination and having standards for doing that on the web, so it&apos;s a lot about payswarm, but i&apos;ll try to also cover payments in the browser</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  then onto W3C TPAC in china: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/11/TPAC/">http://www.w3.org/2013/11/TPAC/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  anyone from mozilla?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  i&apos;m not sure, not that i know of</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we&apos;d like to try and get more W3C member companies to join web payments, chrome team, apple, MS, to participate in payswarm browser API work , etc</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  let&apos;s get a working group started, get some W3C staff assigned, etc. -- to get stuff moving faster than we&apos;re able to do by ourselves, do a workshop there to try and get interest</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  yeah, sounds like a good idea</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there&apos;s Edge too: <a href="http://edgeconf.com/">http://edgeconf.com/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I&apos;ll meet you there, Kumar - we&apos;ll focus on browser payments and PaySwarm.</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Browser Payments Updates</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/web-payments/browser-payments/commit/4ab74174b6440697b0f08a2279b4cdbecb18fb8a">https://github.com/web-payments/browser-payments/commit/4ab74174b6440697b0f08a2279b4cdbecb18fb8a</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so i updated the browser payments spec, made a fairly simple set of commits, mostly what we discussed on the call last week</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://web-payments.github.io/browser-payments/">http://web-payments.github.io/browser-payments/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i know you had some questions in there that i haven&apos;t been able to look at in there</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  the only main question was that we were going to just specify the .well-known path and the fields needed</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  ok, i wasn&apos;t sure we agreed to that, i can take a pass and just put it in there</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so right now they specify an ID and a services URL which is going to be that .well-known path, i didn&apos;t know if we wanted to keep the ID for the service provider separate from the path used to look up the information</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  about the service, because you could provide different services, there could be a payswarm URL and a browser payments URL ,etc</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there are two ways to do things, could just have an ID and based on the type of provider they would know what suffix to put onto .well-known</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  is that what you were thinking?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  it seemed like we have a need to declare a registration URL and for mozPay we already need a URL for the beginning of the payment flow, so i figured that since there are 2 URLs already we could start the .well-known spec now and add more things later, otherwise we&apos;re going to clutter up the object</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  yeah, exactly, i&apos;ll go ahead and add .well-known/payments for now</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  maybe /transact</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  yeah, it&apos;s more generic but not too generic for what we want</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  i think transact is better than payments</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  also, donations - people might not consider them payments. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  Is &apos;transact&apos; the right form? &apos;transactions&apos; [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  let&apos;s look at what other people have done for naming and figure out the details of what we want later</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the other question that came up is whether or not refund should be a different call</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: should we have navigator.transaction.refund()?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: should we have navigator.transact.refund()?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: should we have navigator.transact.donate()?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: should we have navigator.transact.crowdfund()?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We should talk about JWT vs. JSON-LD first. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  my preference is to use an object because it&apos;s more extensible</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  i agree for the same reason</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  i agree</div>
<h1 id="topic-4" class="topic">Topic: ISSUE-2: Pure chrome-based buyflow</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/web-payments/browser-payments/issues/2">https://github.com/web-payments/browser-payments/issues/2</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/web-payments/browser-payments/commit/a0885d71abbc90efad5743752f67b014f7143b26#L0R735">https://github.com/web-payments/browser-payments/commit/a0885d71abbc90efad5743752f67b014f7143b26#L0R735</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  two high-level use cases to support, 1. in-app payments where customer clicks buy and automatic budget/authorization so that when they click payment just goes through automatically</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  2. where a customer doesn&apos;t have a budget set up and they click buy and see a receipt</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  any other main uses caseS?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  no, makes sense to me, we should call that out in the spec as something that&apos;s required of the user-agent, the one-click payment might require a slightly different implementation, some memory to store something to make repeat payments</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  maybe there would be prefetching of a URL to check for authorization for one-clicks, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the flows would be different for providers, for payswarm, the customer would click the button and the browser itself would digitally sign the contract to make a purchase</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  for google wallet it would require a different kind of flow</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i&apos;m wondering if we need something in the spec to say a one-click purchase has been started and the vendor has to implement some part of it, so having a callback where the browser is going to contact the payment provider, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  i think it&apos;s very possible to make it work generically so it&apos;s about making things route properly</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I&apos;m not sure that this is even required for the PaySwarm case. The vendor knows if payments are pre-authorized. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  In the PaySwarm case, the vendor doesn&apos;t even need to use this API. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  What about the non-preauthorized case? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  That&apos;s a different use case. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Travis Choma</span>:  In the case of pre-authorized cases, this could be a zero-click purchase... payments made by regular use of website. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  yeah, it doesn&apos;t matter at all for pre-authorization, it could be a subscription, etc. no user input</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so maybe one-click is a red-herring, we&apos;re talking about payments that need authorization vs. ones that don&apos;t</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  i agree, but i dont&apos; think we need to make any changes to the spec, we just need to call things out in the spec because it may require changes to how navigator.pay is implemented in the user agent, because, for instance, it&apos;s implemented right now so that a window is always opened which we wouldn&apos;t want in some cases</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  we might need to add something like the register call that says &quot;set a preference&quot; to remember one-click payments</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  yeah maybe just a set of prefs that says if the payment is under X then don&apos;t ask me, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  for this vendor, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  mozilla is very interested in one-click payments, so it&apos;s on our radar next, we haven&apos;t put any thought into it yet because we&apos;re always showing a pin before the user can make a purchase</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  maybe what we need is to suggest that the browser/user agent implement a set of preferences that are associated with each website</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  those preferences could allow payments to be done automatically, could allow receipts to always been shown after purchases, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  in addition to the API ... when a purchase is done they could add something to indicate that something has been preauthorized</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  we need to be able to set a preference on the device</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so there is going to be a section of the spec for preferences for user agents to implement</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  maybe just saying that the user-agent needs to support one-click payments</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  ok, i&apos;ll take a cut at some text for this</div>
<h1 id="topic-5" class="topic">Topic: Application-specific data in a JWT</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  kumar, could you outline what the thought process was for selecting JWT?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and where mozilla would like to see things go in the future</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  JWT was just selected so we could verify a signature ... and it seemed straightforward, we looked at google wallet and wanted to keep parity with their format, we could change if there are some good arguments, it&apos;s not a big deal</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  we want it to be as simple as possible as devs will have to deal with this</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  there are probably good arguments to this</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  but it definitely seems to add a little bit of complexity</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  i&apos;ve looked at some of how MS&apos;s payment API works and it&apos;s pretty complex with a lot of types and restrictions, some sort of XML format and i don&apos;t think it has to be that complex, we want to avoid complexity it&apos;s a goal</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so the goal behind JSON-LD was to make something familiar to JSON devs without adding too much complex</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there&apos;s complexity in the background but it&apos;s hidden by just using a library</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the reason we&apos;re using JSON-LD -- the primary reason -- is to support decentralized extensibility, we want people to be able to provide more information in digital contracts that they can&apos;t do otherwise</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  say like you buy things at home depot, could home depot embed data that is very specific to home depot into that digital contract to the customer and then keep that data as the data for the sale, is it possible for the vendor to extend the data in there</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if we can do the same sort of thing with JWT that&apos;s great, but the downside of JWT is that there are two different signature stacks for JSON-LD vs. JWT</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i think the goals are aligned, in that we&apos;re trying to reduce complexity as much as possible, we don&apos;t want to get into a situation where we are at MS-XML format level</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i was going to try and sit down and do a comparison between them</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  of JWT and JSON-LD</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think that we may find that JSON-LD has features that you don&apos;t /have/ to use. The JSON will probably not look very different from what the JWT already looks like. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  yeah, i already went through and saw that we could use the same format with JWT as JSON-LD</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  JSON-LD would be used for decentralization. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  does mozilla use a JS JWT lib?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  we do it on the server, so it&apos;s python</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  for JSON-LD we have python, JS, php, ruby</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  would you need anything in C++ for the client?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  i don&apos;t know, we could ship that i guess</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  we&apos;re just doing stuff on the server now for signatures, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we can do that stuff in JS now, we have <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  yeah, right, it can be done, but from a security standpoint there&apos;s no good way to store a private key yet</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  on the client</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  right</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  i think that calling things out with JWT like it isn&apos;t very extensible because it just has a string field for 255 chars of user data</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  would be helpful</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  ok, makes sense</div>
