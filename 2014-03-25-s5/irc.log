10:39:06 <m4nu> Topic: Session 5: Front End: Wallets - Initiating Payment and Digital Receipts
10:39:09 <darobin> darobin has joined #W3Cpayment
10:39:12 <chaals> Prakash: good news is things are growing in online payment.
10:39:16 <erik_anderson> erik_anderson has joined #w3cpayment
10:39:31 <m4nu> scribenick: chaals
10:39:31 <chaals> â€¦ bad news, the experience is a mess. Repeated repetition of terrible steps to go through.
10:39:45 <max> max has joined #w3cpayment
10:39:51 <chaals> â€¦ m-commerce rates < 1% - imagine what it could be without such friction.
10:39:52 <Emil> Emil has joined #W3Cpayment

10:40:33 <lesellier> lesellier has joined #w3cpayment
10:40:33 <chaals> â€¦ we've got different stakeholders here and tried to cover the world. 2.5 billion are underbanked...
10:40:48 <Cyril> Cyril has joined #W3Cpayment
10:40:51 <chaals> â€¦ We're focusing on b2c payment.
10:40:58 <TomPic> TomPic has joined #W3CPayment
10:41:23 <chaals> â€¦ will consider this a success if we can narrow our focus on what needs to be standardised.
10:41:49 <mdadas> mdadas has joined #w3cpayment
10:42:00 <chaals> DSR: Creating a level playing field for providers.
10:42:29 <chaals> -> http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/front-end.pdf Dave's slides
10:42:45 <chaals> â€¦ I want to be able to get a digital receipt from a part-payment for a group meal.
10:42:58 <jeff> jeff has joined #w3cpayment
10:43:12 <chaals> [repeats Jeff Jaffe's slide of where we might standardise...]
10:43:30 <m4nu> That was actually Dave's initial slide - not Jeff's
10:44:11 <Jonny> Jonny has joined #w3cpayment
10:44:11 <chaals> DSR: We have web app -> browser transition, and then browser -> wallet conversation, and wallets talking to individual providers, as possible points of standardisation.
10:44:23 <chaals> â€¦ and we can have multiple wallets, like int he real world.
10:44:39 <chaals> â€¦ standards should be minimal, enabling competition
10:44:57 <chaals> â€¦ information needed (slide 5)
10:45:29 <chaals> â€¦ amount, currency, jurisdiction, acceptable settlement solutions, etc.
10:45:30 <kjheimark> kjheimark has joined #w3cpayment
10:45:43 <chaals> â€¦ in current UX we have to repeatedly add too much info. Could be done by the wallet
10:46:00 <chaals> â€¦ Maybe you need DRM for virtual goods.
10:46:35 <chaals> â€¦ What about value-added services - what is compelling enough to get people to switch. Loyalty coupons (seemed very US-centric idea), ...
10:46:43 <SartoriMichele> SartoriMichele has joined #W3CPayment
10:46:51 <chaals> â€¦ Where does escrow fit.
10:47:00 <chaals> [slide 6]
10:47:21 <chaals> DSR: Wallet can keep receipts etc. Where does the receipt get held?
10:47:36 <chaals> [chaals: that was my question about receipts helping eme yesterday]
10:48:03 <chaals> DSR: It's about improving the experience. Less data entry. This just depends on the risk model for provider/customer - the merchant just wants the money
10:48:10 <chaals> q+ to say the merchant wants user data too
10:48:13 <virginie> virginie has joined #w3cpayment
10:48:15 <chaals> [slide 7]
10:48:30 <dezell> dezell has joined #w3cpayment
10:48:43 <bryan> usecase: wallet as an expert system
10:48:55 <chaals> DSR: trusted customers can have expert wallets as user agents. Shouldn't offer solutions that won't match the acceptable mechanisms fora  transaction.
10:49:17 <chaals> â€¦ wallets need to provide information, options for payment (use debit, or pay with coupons, â€¦)
10:49:26 <chaals> â€¦ and of course transparency in eventual cost.
10:49:31 <chaals> [slide 8]
10:50:07 <chaals> DSR: standardisation needs to be unbiased, we need to be held to that. Effective competition is critical for improvement, so we need hooks in browsers for multiple wallets to be used / dropped.
10:50:18 <chaals> â€¦ these could be in teh cloud, or notâ€¦
10:50:29 <chaals> â€¦ And should be movable between my devices.
10:50:45 <chaals> â€¦ What about offline payments? That's a complexity we should bear in mind for the future.
10:50:50 <chaals> [slide 9]
10:51:07 <bryan> offline payments is a current capability, not only something for the future
10:51:23 <chaals> DSR: Sysapps is working on APIs for trusted applications, allowing web apps to create device side part of wallet is a possibility.
10:51:37 <chaals> â€¦ need to move away from username/password as the base of authentication.
10:51:52 <chaals> â€¦ What happens when I give someone else my device?
10:51:53 <Jonny> Jonny has joined #w3cpayment
10:52:08 <chaals> â€¦ privacy friendly "Know Your Customer"?
10:52:24 <bryan> identity of all parties is essential for trust - Know Your Provider (KYP)
10:52:39 <chaals> â€¦ related - NFC, and upcoming bluetooth work at W3C
10:52:45 <chaals> [slide 10]
10:53:21 <chaals> DSR: Loyalty schemes as value-adding services for a wallet. coupons, vouchers, etc - how does this fit. Maybe a question for the future.
10:53:37 <chaals> â€¦ Merchants want repeat customers, want to know how users arrived.
10:53:42 <chaals> q?
10:54:30 <bryan> I use a Safeway app that provides me discounts on things that I typically buy, and alerts me when they're on sale, and uses barcodes so that I can "like" products right in the store - all key parts of the new retail experience.
10:55:04 <Cyril> careful of loyality coupons : the business model is that the customer value them but don't uses them ;-)
10:55:06 <chaals> Vidya: money for the un/derbanked
10:55:23 <chaals> â€¦ who is familiar with mobile money? [almost everyone]
10:55:53 <chaals> [slide 2, recaps yesterday points]
10:56:07 <chaals> Vidya: 2.5B underbanked, big opportunity
10:56:28 <chaals> â€¦ growing industry increasingly competitive. dominated by telcos.
10:56:33 <bryan> just like the payment experience - make the couponing experience transparent/effortless and usage will increase and churn will decrease
10:56:49 <chaals> â€¦ very lightly regulated, no interoperability.
10:56:55 <chaals> [slide 4 - stats]
10:56:56 <erik_anderson> erik_anderson has joined #w3cpayment
10:57:16 <chaals> Vidya: 1.2B users in 9 months. 2.5B un/derbanked people online in 3 years
10:57:32 <chaals> [slide 5 - africa research]
10:57:52 <chaals> Vidya: Huge growth in everything - 100's of % CAGR
10:58:43 <chaals> â€¦ Kenya 5th fastest towards cashless society because of mpesa
10:58:51 <chaals> q: what's the axis?
10:59:02 <chaals> comment: It's just marketing pictures
10:59:18 <chaals> Vidya: Shows mpesa changes the way a country deals with cash, which is a surprise
11:00:03 <marie> marie has joined #w3cpayment
11:00:03 <chaals> â€¦ Money systems don't interoperate, no public API. That will change soon to have an ecosystem building around it. There is already a mini-industry offering integration, bridging, etc.
11:00:32 <chaals> â€¦ Strong growth trajectory, time to leverage the synergy with standardisation.
11:00:44 <chaals> â€¦ otherwise experience will be siloed.
11:00:57 <mark_> mark_ has joined #W3Cpayment
11:01:06 <chaals> â€¦ Where will mobile money fit in a layered appraoch?
11:01:19 <chaals> [slide - Standardisation Considerations]
11:01:45 <chaals> Vidya: different from cards, this is a stored value system on a phone not card.
11:02:04 <chaals> â€¦ mobile number is account nuber, but portability signals a coming need to change that.
11:02:18 <chaals> â€¦ low tech literacy means UX needs to be simple, smooth.
11:02:45 <chaals> â€¦ 2-factor auth is inherent in mobile money.
11:02:52 <chaals> [chaals wonders why]
11:03:29 <chaals> Vidya: Category of goods that can be purchased could be limited by account type.
11:03:40 <bryan> q+ to ask why portability is a concern for use of mobile # as account key
11:03:46 <chaals> â€¦ consumer demographics include multiple languages, multiple currencies, low literacy, ...
11:04:10 <chaals> â€¦P2P transfer is big in mobile money, that's where the traction has been.
11:04:49 <chaals> â€¦ what is relevant for merchants is proximity not online payment.
11:05:06 <chaals> â€¦ Mobile payments are done on mobiles, not cards, and that's what's different about it.
11:05:54 <chaals> Philippe: Who uses a mobile wallet daily?
11:06:03 <chaals> [few]
11:06:26 <chaals> Philippe: that's why I am here. Think this is really key to help adoption of payment technology. WIll focus mostly on UX
11:07:05 <chaals> â€¦ key aspect is that the wallets should be multi-scheme multi-technology from the start.
11:07:17 <chaals> â€¦ acccept MNO billing, alternates, â€¦
11:07:58 <chaals> â€¦ Why is user expecting so much? There is a lack of control for the end user on what payment to use, clear reward for doing so, and feeling secure about the payment
11:08:29 <chaals> â€¦ Giving my data to multiple websites doesn't feel secure, I want a wallet to keep them in.
11:08:50 <Angie> Angie has joined #w3cpayment
11:09:06 <chaals> â€¦ I don't know the balances on my cards, want to see them (or info about the differences in different cards at merchants) at purchase time.
11:09:18 <Harish_> Harish_ has joined #W3Cpayment
11:09:20 <jpotvin> jpotvin has joined #W3Cpayment
11:09:33 <chaals> â€¦ I don't have a central point to store receipts.
11:09:53 <chaals> usecase: go to london and spend schuki's friend's money on coffee
11:10:11 <bryan> usecase: realtime checks on account balances in wallets to help decide how to pay
11:10:32 <chaals> â€¦ payment process can be very painful. To secure it with 2-factor can bring problems e.g. trying to use CAPTCHA on mobiles.
11:11:09 <chaals> â€¦ login is painful across multiple sites. Wallet can help here.
11:11:37 <chaals> â€¦ Today there are lots of loyalty cards, but don't see a reward. Wallet could show you that
11:11:54 <chaals> usecase: showing added value from things you already do
11:12:11 <chaals> Philippe: Blockers to having this lovely wallet?
11:12:31 <chaals> â€¦ need more implementations to be availble, more ways to deploy wallets.
11:12:45 <chaals> â€¦ ability to port wallet to various platforms is key.
11:13:05 <bryan> usecase: wallet is synced with loyalty coupons and digital receipts as they are collected
11:13:15 <m4nu> How about this: You should be able to store your digital receipts wherever you want - whether it  be in a wallet or in the cloud.
11:13:19 <chaals> â€¦ W3C can help abstract and standardise these interfaces to reduce the cost of deployment.
11:13:37 <bryan> cloud or device would be included in the previous usecase
11:13:42 <chaals> â€¦ Unfortunately, wallet issuers are too eager for user data, so seems like a privacy threat.
11:14:11 <chaals> â€¦ end user should be able to choose what info to share with whom. Think this will be key.
11:14:34 <chaals> â€¦ of course need to standardise interations with merchant website - coupons, sharing shipping addresses, etc
11:14:56 <chaals> â€¦ smartphone is a good way to allow users to select payments.
11:15:20 <chaals> â€¦ Need to make sure wallets are widespread and available, believe W3C is the right place to make sure there will be an open garden type of wallet
11:15:41 <bryan> I agree, a wallet issuer should not have access to my data just because they provided the wallet
11:15:50 <chaals> Gregory: What do we need to standardise on front end for wallets to integrate.
11:16:04 <chaals> â€¦ What merchant wants isn't always what customer wants.
11:16:33 <chaals> â€¦ Purchase: There is a cart. Some providers require the cart contents to be passed to the payment provider.
11:17:01 <chaals> â€¦ There are some advantages - if customer goes to another website, will be pleased to see the cart is still the same.
11:17:15 <chaals> â€¦ Provides valable information for fraud detection, digital receipts.
11:17:46 <chaals> â€¦ But drawbacks too - consistency has to be achieveed. And raises privacy concerns - does the customer want all purchase information detail given to the bank?
11:18:02 <chaals> â€¦ Then billing and shipping info. Most annoying part of the process.
11:18:27 <jonny> jonny has joined #w3cpayment
11:18:31 <chaals> â€¦ But while cart is temporary, these are related to identity (which is its own can of worms)
11:18:47 <chaals> â€¦ When it all goes well, everyone wants to skip this and let the wallet do it.
11:19:23 <chaals> â€¦ But if something goes wrong with the purchase, some privacy concerns are raised. Merchant acquires information about a non-customer, device fingerprinting them, etc.
11:19:41 <chaals> â€¦ like in the physical world. Merchant wants the customerto open the wallet, customer doesn't.
11:20:12 <chaals> [chaals: Merchant wants customer to start buyijg. and then buy more]
11:20:56 <chaals> Gregory: There is a process to figure out which system is the best. Payment schemes have deals with merchants, customers have different goals.
11:21:34 <chaals> â€¦ for instance a merchant might have a reason (or 2â‚¬) to try and sign you up to a new wallet
11:22:03 <chaals> â€¦ At payment there are mostly security concerns. Merchants shouldn't collect credit card details, but part of these are meaningful.
11:22:29 <chaals> â€¦ E.g. issuer may determine where the merchant wants to process the transaction.
11:22:41 <chaals> Prakash: Merchants should just get a token, not real credentials?
11:22:57 <chaals> Gregory: Partially, but there are parts of the information the merchant should get too.
11:23:54 <chaals> â€¦ e.g. in PCIDSS you mask middle of the number. But on POS terminals masking is first 12 digits. Merchant loses important information on what kind of card it is.
11:24:03 <chaals> s/POS/modern POS/
11:24:59 <chaals> â€¦ 3D secure, etc can be involved. This is a real pain point. UX is bad, website is mobile-first and often -only, terrible on desktop.
11:25:17 <chaals> â€¦ SMS auth when you purchase from your phone is no good if your phone gets stolen.
11:25:31 <chaals> â€¦ But birthday security in a facebooked world is even worse.
11:25:54 <chaals> â€¦ We could stepwise propose better integration for most common auth schemes.
11:26:12 <chaals> [chaals: this sounds like password management in browsers, which is years old]
11:26:37 <chaals> Gregory: We could alternatively enrich the authentication process with branding from the merchant website.
11:28:05 <chaals> â€¦ Then there is receipts. There are many receipts. Merchant-supplied, something from a payment provider. If customer uses coupons and loyalty cards, the amount of money will be dispatched around the world with tex and handling fees from different places coming into play. Standardising this seems difficult.
11:28:35 <chaals> â€¦ Merchant receipts are a sales facilitator. Lots of the receipt is used to offer coupons, advertising, etc.
11:28:48 <Cyril> standard for receipts should be "cumulative" i.e. each actor could add its won information for the receipt during the payment life cycle
11:28:59 <chaals> â€¦ problem is payment-gateway receipts.
11:29:35 <chaals> â€¦ They should be digitally signed, merchant receipts will be useable for warranty.
11:30:00 <chaals> Jorg: Identity, privacy and mobile
11:30:11 <Cyril> waranty or tax issues
11:30:46 <chaals> [Cyril: so who "owns" the receipt content?]
11:31:38 <chaals> Jorg: Not talking about a product, just what we think a wallet might look like
11:31:55 <chaals> [slide development history]
11:32:14 <chaals> â€¦ started in NFC, infocard. Found that compelling in the context of payments.
11:32:48 <chaals> â€¦ so we created a wallet - same virtual card can be used on payment terminal or web shop.
11:33:21 <m4nu> Use Case: (from Ernesto) User can receive digital receipts (receipt POSTed to user's digital receipt storage vs. an emailed receipt)
11:33:35 <chaals> â€¦ want a framework independent of implemnetation, so the card is an abstraction, where people can make payments with whatever instruments they have.
11:34:01 <chaals> â€¦ so far only used in trials. Aspiration to cover tickets and identity as well as payments seems feasible
11:34:25 <chaals> â€¦ expect any account online becomes a virtual customer card.
11:34:44 <chaals> [slide - wallet vision "so abstract it can't be wrong"]
11:35:29 <chaals> Jorg: providing security and communication needed for transaction. The actual transaction happens outside the actual wallet, but there are times when it appears. it's mine on my system that I can secure.
11:35:40 <jpotvin> wallet architecture needs to be open to any type of implementation technology
11:35:44 <chaals> â€¦ This is an agreement between me and a payment provider.
11:36:07 <chaals> â€¦ maybe I can use NFC, hardware-secured ID management, OAuth, â€¦ or not ...
11:36:30 <chaals> â€¦ I just need to be told what level of security I am ignoring at the moment.
11:37:10 <chaals> â€¦ When I join airline program, I get a number on paper - this is free to issue. If I get more miles, I may get a card with NFC access to lounge, etc.
11:37:21 <chaals> [chaals already has that cardâ€¦]
11:37:46 <chaals> Jorg: The ecosystem needs to be arrange differently from what people think.
11:37:56 <chaals> [slide - future wallet definition]
11:38:08 <chaals> Jorg: This is user-centric (everyone says thatâ€¦)
11:38:20 <chaals> â€¦ we give the card to the user. Maybe that never holds any more data.
11:38:39 <chaals> â€¦ can make things more transparent to the end-user.
11:38:46 <chaals> â€¦ wallet provider is important role.
11:39:08 <chaals> â€¦ better if it isn't a payment provider too.
11:39:27 <chaals> â€¦ Operator might be OK for that - or not. Service providers need to be differentiated.
11:40:01 <chaals> [last slide]
11:40:27 <chaals> Jorg: We already have lots of APIs. Our wallet is implemented in HTML5. Could be cloud-based or belong on client device.
11:40:27 <jonny> jonny has joined #w3cpayment
11:40:40 <chaals> â€¦ You could have several wallets doing partial synchronisation
11:41:16 <chaals> â€¦ we can have wallet responding to auth requests. It can be done, but lack of standards makes it a mess.
11:41:30 <chaals> â€¦ and then we want all the things people already said - start transactions, etc.
11:42:09 <Cyril> I suggest to include along with cards the 3 other main payment mecanisms konwn : credit transfer, direct debit, crypto currency
11:43:05 <chaals> Natasha: Jorg covered a lot of the technical detail of where we are going.
11:43:37 <chaals> â€¦ a long time ago we were working on projects, eg with NFC. That has started to change, providing trusted security modules around SIMs and wallet has become important to us.
11:44:00 <chaals> â€¦ we want a simple approach from customer viewpoint (with business things wrapped around it)
11:44:10 <chaals> â€¦ Idea is use a wallet to pay, and it has security.
11:44:34 <chaals> â€¦ Spec is for operator-led wallets held on the device. Sometimes may not need secure elements all the time.
11:44:57 <chaals> [chaals loves that people can steal everything if they take it in 20s...]
11:45:47 <chaals> â€¦ CAPTCHA is painful, wallets will simplify life by having your details on your device
11:46:15 <andym> andym has joined #w3cpayment
11:46:38 <chaals> â€¦ Lot of work going on around Identity. Generally there is a lot of movement towards identity providers/managers. Who do customers choose - my main one now is Google. I made that choice (and people gasp) based on what I get...
11:46:59 <chaals> â€¦ It's up to you - what country is your data held in, what do you get, do you trust the company, â€¦
11:47:20 <chaals> â€¦ not much uptake for identity by interpretive dance yet. But we want to do it in the most secure way we can.
11:48:00 <chaals> â€¦ The process of buying a 30p sweet shouldn't involve 2-factor authentication.
11:48:18 <m4nu> q?
11:48:28 <chaals> â€¦ There is a heavy business aspect around wallets. Who holds the data and what are they getting by doing it?
11:48:45 <chaals> â€¦ and can we hold you money for a while too?
11:48:47 <m4nu> q+ to raise the point that if we store wallet information on device, that we're inevitably going to need to sync it to the "cloud"
11:48:48 <Ori-Eisen> Ori-Eisen has joined #W3Cpayment
11:49:28 <chaals> â€¦ We still have to deal with these issues. Which leads to merchants. They are losing valuable data to wallets, paymetn providers, etc. Merchants have to weigh up the cost benefit
11:49:49 <chaals> â€¦ Don't believe it is our choice.
11:50:34 <jpotvin> interpretive dance --- bees do that
11:51:02 <chaals> â€¦ There has been a lot of talk about choosing your payment provider on your device. Something that wants to get paid giving you a button to click and pay it, backed by whatever you have chosen to use, this leads back to tokenisation.
11:51:33 <chaals> â€¦ Final point - lose your  phone is a real issue. We'd like to see more activity in the cloud - but not sure which cloud.
11:51:44 <mhepp> mhepp has joined #w3cpayment
11:51:48 <m4nu> q?
11:52:00 <mountie> q+
11:52:00 <steph> q+
11:52:13 <mhepp> Present+ mhepp
11:52:17 <steph> q+ to ask how can an operator be a wallet provider
11:52:19 <chaals> Prakash: talked of consumers, merchants, wallet/payment provider
11:52:35 <chaals> â€¦ does everyone agree with Dave's characterisation of the three points for standardisation?
11:52:39 <erik_anderson> q+
11:52:39 <jpotvin> "connect the dots" mobile lock/unlock is an real application of finger-based interpretive dance
11:52:42 <dka> q?
11:53:01 <dka> q+
11:53:29 <chaals> OlivierMass: Reacting to wallet interface. Philippe showed few people use them today, retail wallets more success than bank wallets but that will lead to us having lots of them. Wonder if we will talk about them in 5 years.
11:54:17 <chaals> â€¦ surprised nobody has mentioned trend to personal data stores, to me describe use cases which fit with the seamless UX better than wallets which are repeated one-shot transaction interfaces
11:54:29 <chaals> â€¦ my point: don't restrict the interface to wallets.
11:54:51 <chaals> â€¦ they are just a 'new' way to do payments today.
11:54:57 <jpotvin> q
11:55:01 <Sergio_Aquero> Sergio_Aquero has joined #w3cpayment
11:55:14 <jpotvin> q+
11:55:18 <Sergio_Aquero> "Wallet" presupposes an architecture
11:55:25 <Sergio_Aquero> it's one way of handling the payment request
11:55:39 <chaals> DSR: Agree - wallet is a personal assistant, not a container for payment cards. There will be assistants, e.g. help manage expenses, tell you not to buy more ice cream. Think those value-added services are key
11:55:48 <virginie> q?
11:56:20 <chaals> Jorg: Should be cautious about putting too much into the wallet. But one power of the notion of a mobile wallet is as an authorisation agent.
11:56:31 <chaals> â€¦ but it needs to be somehow cloud-capable, synchronised, â€¦
11:56:44 <chaals> â€¦ what we call it I don't know.
11:56:55 <virginie> q?
11:57:41 <dka> q?
11:57:47 <chaals> Prakash: Does anyone think P2P payment belongs in the primitive set?
11:57:49 <schuki> ack chaals
11:57:49 <Zakim> chaals, you wanted to say the merchant wants user data too
11:57:55 <chaals> Chaals, Jorg: Yes
11:57:55 <dezell> dezell has joined #w3cpayment
11:57:57 <steph> ack bryan
11:57:57 <Zakim> bryan, you wanted to ask why portability is a concern for use of mobile # as account key
11:58:35 <chaals> Bryan: You commented on prtoability as a problem for using mobile number as account identifier.

11:59:20 <m4nu> q?
11:59:36 <chaals> Vidya: Mobile money uses the number as an account identifier. When the number gets ported to another telephony provider, the money account may stay with the original money operator, which can become a problem.
11:59:43 <steph> ack m4nu
11:59:43 <Zakim> m4nu, you wanted to raise the point that if we store wallet information on device, that we're inevitably going to need to sync it to the "cloud"
11:59:43 <chaals> Bryan: Not sure if it does, butâ€¦
12:00:05 <chaals> Manu: Wallet is best word we have, but isn't really ideal. So we will get misunderstanding from that.
12:00:14 <bryan> ? re the last question are use cases equivalent to primitives ? "P2P", "B2C" are use cases, not primitives
12:00:24 <chaals> â€¦ Growing concern about where the contents of the wallet are stored. People have more than one device, so they have to synch.
12:00:32 <chaals> q+ to ask about shared devies
12:00:43 <bryan> a primitive is e.g. "make a payment request", "get a receipt", etc
12:00:45 <chaals> â€¦ Wallets are not the only things that get synched these days
12:01:10 <chaals> â€¦ maybe W3C should think about synching in general. We probably want this stuff on the web not on the device
12:01:19 <schuki> ack mountie
12:01:51 <jonny> q+
12:02:00 <chaals> Mountie: mobile is now the megatrend but wasn't always, and we're also talking about internet of things, wearable devices, vehicles as clients.

12:02:30 <bryan> usecase: wallet portability to new wallet service provider
12:02:49 <jameslei> jameslei has joined #W3Cpayment
12:02:59 <chaals> â€¦ wallet is targeting for human interaction based on mobiles and brings a risk of adding a layer of activity, with W3C trying to take the role of banks and payment service providers. And this is too complex.
12:03:19 <m4nu> q?
12:03:21 <chaals> â€¦ User and user agent is the centre, and standards need to concentrate on the connections between the devices.
12:04:40 <chaals> Steph: There are different views of the wallet. Could be a very light element supporting payment. If we can gather payment systems, that's great. If it's another layer that we need, I think we will fail - getting everyone to delegate everything to a wallet will be a challenge.
12:04:46 <Mauro> ack steph
12:04:46 <Zakim> steph, you wanted to ask how can an operator be a wallet provider
12:05:12 <chaals> â€¦ how can a mobie provider be a wallet provider, when you change operator all the time - from phone to wifi to roaming to ...
12:05:55 <Mauro> s/mobie/mobile/
12:06:06 <chaals> Jorg: I'm here to reduce complexity. Today all platforms need different implmentations. standardise this through a layer of abstraction - it's feasible and would help to have a good identity abstraction layer. We don't have it yet.
12:06:06 <dka> q?
12:06:18 <chaals> â€¦ Who looks at certificate stores?
12:06:42 <bryan> steph, the ISP/MNO can be the wallet provider just like anyone else. ISPs/MNOs are not limited to serving users over specific networks - they can be cloud-based service providers just like anyone else. The IdM key that is used is also not necessarily tied to specific networks.
12:06:44 <chaals> â€¦ If we can brand strong authentication (Walmart security anyone) you could sell it.
12:06:49 <Ori-Eisen> q+
12:07:14 <chaals> Steph: Is it a technical issue? I think that isn't the problem, it is about getting agreement to delegate the work.
12:07:17 <Ori-Eisen> what is "strong authentication"?
12:07:49 <virginie> q?
12:07:55 <chaals> Jorg: We're missing the motivation to accept the extra complexity of security, while for big players it is cheaper to just use risk-management. We're pushing toward monopolistic tendencies because the large players don't need anything new.
12:08:01 <melvster> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_authentication
12:08:17 <mhepp> q+
12:08:31 <chaals> â€¦ what we do today is nonsense for security, but it works for the existing market. I hope the neutral position at W3C can enable us to make something usable and attractive enough to get adopted
12:08:40 <Ori-Eisen> my point is that "strong authnetication" is a relative term, compared to what are we trying to authenticate
12:09:07 <chaals> Natasha: How can we make this implementable? Everyone agrees that mobile number is a bad identifier.
12:09:25 <dka> q?
12:09:41 <chaals> â€¦ If you have a contract there are a lot of ways to be identified. Liked the idea if you're paying to use the name of the event not the person.
12:10:02 <chaals> â€¦ GSMA standardising a wallet isn't about forcing everyone to use it, it is making a business product for operators.
12:10:19 <Emil> I think that a definition of "strong authnetication" is needed.
12:10:24 <phobeo> q?
12:10:27 <chaals> â€¦ If there is a hook in the wallet to say "now please pay" and the standards are agnostic to the wallet chosen, that is interesting.
12:10:39 <bryan> Not sure I agree that mobile number is a bad identifier. It's just an ID like all others, and in fact one that everyone understands and uses every day;
12:10:39 <chaals> â€¦ comes back to the customer choosing what to do.
12:11:01 <mhepp> IMO, security in payment cannot be built into the standards. instead, it will be a highly adaptive component that permits or declines a transaction based on 100+ signals.
12:11:06 <chaals> â€¦ this is achievable in the short term - which isn't always the case with a complex set of stakeholders.
12:11:16 <chaals> â€¦ It isn't the be-all answer.
12:12:00 <chaals> ErikA: Mobile wallets aren't that useful, which explains some low usage. Concerned about device storing wallet, being the 2-factor auth vector and synching to the cloud. It becomes a single point of massive failure.
12:12:07 <chaals> ack er
12:12:11 <Jorg> Jorg has joined #W3Cpayment
12:12:45 <m4nu> Use Case: Where is the wallet, how is it protected, is it stored on the same device as your 2-factor authentication device? Security side-effects of mobile-as-wallet are not straightforward.
12:12:52 <chaals> Cyril: When you go to a merchant, we almost know what they are. If you go to a certificate chain it gives no information. The policy is a nightmare.
12:13:17 <chaals> â€¦ I don't know what is going on as a user. Is a problem of trust to explain this better -what the certification means?
12:13:45 <chaals> â€¦ signed by someone *I* trust, not a chain of trusted trusted trusters?
12:13:53 <chaals> â€¦ maybe this is part of an extension.
12:13:58 <m4nu> +1 to mhepp wrt. security must be modular.
12:14:11 <wseltzer> q+ re exposing security UI to users
12:14:21 <chaals> Jorg: This transparency needs to be used with care. Users need to put a name to the responsibility. If they trust a brand, they don't question it.
12:14:56 <mhepp> The standards should support interoperability at the data (and maybe process) level, but not standardize the implementation and internal processes of components.
12:15:11 <chaals> â€¦ they allow for trust to be distributed. It needs to be transparent, but a lot of real trust comes from trusting on particular brands. We can use that to help get acceptance, or misunderstand it and build stuff that fails
12:15:48 <chaals> DKA: I'm worried about the notion of standardising a wallet. feels like the wrong level of abstraction.
12:16:13 <chaals> â€¦ some twitter comment said startups should be the innovators. Feels like an attempt to create an app, not underlying technologies.
12:16:44 <phobeo> q?
12:16:49 <bryan> dave, standardizing interface primitives and data formats for browser interface with a wallet is not the same as standardizing the wallet - so we are not standardizing the wallet really - implementations are free to innovate / differentiate
12:16:54 <phobeo> q+
12:16:54 <chaals> â€¦ maybe better takeaway for W3C is to look at use cases in the context of existing work - look at synch in teh context of storage work, â€¦ what are the primitives for multiple wallets?
12:17:34 <bryan> q?
12:17:40 <chaals> DSR: Idea is to create a space for innovation. Maybe we don't need to standardise synch. What are the *minimal* set of standards that meet the primary goals - innovation, merchants' and users' needs met
12:17:40 <Jorg> Wallet should be seen as a Concept helping us to guide standardization in various fields ! (security, identity, identity selectors, transaction framing)...
12:17:56 <phobeo> there may be a bit of confusion about what is "a wallet" in this context... because for example for requestAutocomplete spec it already says you store cc and credentials in either "the user agent or other element" (in chrome's implementation in google wallet) so that already defines that there IS a wallet
12:17:59 <virginie> note speaker is gergory estrade
12:18:09 <chaals> Gregory: We are focusing on ID and security, losing sight of what functions and features a wallet can add to payments.
12:18:14 <chaals> ack dka
12:18:39 <erik_anderson> Certificate chains are important.  I know firewall units and corporate policies at corporations that inject its own certificate of authority into your browsers so they can "man-in-the-middle" decrypt SSL traffic.  Corporations do this so they can read your email, prevent file sharing/uploads, but they shouldnt be connected in between the user and what they are purchasing.
12:18:40 <chaals> Prakash: Need to define wallet, by use of a tokenâ€¦.
12:19:20 <mdadas> mdadas has joined #w3cpayment
12:19:20 <chaals> Joseph: I though that authentication through interpretive dance is what a written signature involves. Or the dot-connecting to unlock my phone.

12:19:39 <mhepp> +1 to phobeo
12:19:54 <Angie> Angie has joined #w3cpayment
12:20:02 <chaals> â€¦ drawing a symbol on a tablet can provide an authentication mechanism.
12:20:15 <bryan> phobeo, I personally dont like requestAutocomplete - it's a crutch to help us deal with with a last-gen interaction method (web forms) and is a continual source of privacy concern for me (where is all that info backed up? is it secure? what if someone gets one of my devices that is synced with it?)
12:20:34 <chaals> â€¦ Applying WCAG to this, there are people who are visual, and people who have e.g. dyslexia and huge problems with authentication.
12:21:13 <chaals> Natasha: Identity and how we authenticate will be something we choose- retina, password, use a signature?
12:21:32 <phobeo> whether we like the API or not what I mean is that we need a vocabulary that defines "wallet" because different people have different interpretations and I think user agents are already aiming to behave like at least my interpretation of a wallet, whether directly or via things like requestAutocomplete

12:23:50 <Zakim> ok, steph, the speaker queue is closed
12:24:09 <chaals> Prakash: Shared devices can lead to "friendly fraud". For physical goods the main vector is account takeovers. You need something other than username/password.
12:24:25 <chaals> Jorg: Adding biometry or behavioural auth, these can be solved.
12:25:02 <chaals> â€¦ you can do air writing as a secure instrument. But tests showed germans didn't like it.
12:25:11 <jpotvin> Principles of the  WCAG standard should apply to authentication methods (therefore offer various kinds of authentication)
12:25:33 <chaals> DaveBirch: Mustn't jumble biometrics for authentication (good) with identification (bad)
12:25:53 <chaals> â€¦ corrput officials have been selling bogus national id cards - these things are of limited reliability
12:27:23 <wseltzer> q- later (next session)
12:27:34 <chaals> Evgeny: DSR says there is a problem where to keep receipts. need to differentiate notification from real receipts for eg warranty. Using phone number as identifier - in some countries you need to show ID to have a SIM, and the number is linked to a real person, and then may be useful. Gregory talks about UI problems for security systems - this can be easily solved with a standard by building an API. There is one edit field and one button, not to hard.
12:27:37 <wseltzer> q- later
12:27:42 <chaals> s/to/too/
12:28:07 <chaals> â€¦ How deep should the standard go into communication channels - totally transport-agnostic, or more detail on NFC/bluetooth/whatever?
12:28:23 <erik_anderson> In Indonesia the phone number is locked to a particular SIM card.  If the SIM card expires for over xxx time period the SIM must be replaced and the user gets a new phone number
12:28:23 <schuki> close q
12:28:34 <chaals> Jorg: We framed this with total payment-agnostic. Could do it with EMV, think it works with paypal online, shouldn't matter.

If we stnadardise protocols, the decision to decide if something is fraudulent will be probabilistic. So what should we standardise? Means for interoperability of data. Conceptual structures for stages of initiating, archiving, etc, steps that can be document. Not IMHO processes that determine whether a payment is fraudule[CUT]

12:36:18 <mhepp> thus, we should not standardize processes with a binary outcome of "1 - transaction valid" vs. "0 - transaction declined". The actual decision will be based on tens of signals from the client (e.g. id, geo-location, history), transaction (volume, type of goods), merchant, etc.
12:37:04 <mhepp> instead, we should focus on standardizing data interchange, so that components can exchange the respective signals.
