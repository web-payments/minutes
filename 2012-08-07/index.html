<div class="information">Dave Longley is scribing.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  in addition to the agenda, something came up on the mailing list</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... he asked if payswarm could support a paid app market concept</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Melvin raised this as a point of interest - <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2012Aug/0005.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2012Aug/0005.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and perhaps we should talk about how payswarm enables decentralized webapp stores</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  to allow people to pay to get access to webapps but then also pay small amounts to use features within webapps themselves</div>
<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: Decentralized Web app stores</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I would've figured we had a web app use case [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  we are trying to cover that use case, maybe we have something about a web game</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we should probably add this to the use cases</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  because we are definitely supporting it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  melvin was interested in getting something together as a proof of concept within the month or at least within 3 months</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this is a demo we've been wanting to do for a while, so maybe we can talk with melvin and help it get built</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we have most of the code done (on the payswarm side) for this demo</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think what we have in the PHP or JavaScript code is done ... we have everything required for doing a demo for selling recipes... Web Apps are not that much more different. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We do want something a bit different for the automatic purchase part of it... if the web app store sells a game, and they wanted to do the purchase in the background. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  You could setup a budget for the game at your PaySwarm provider, subsequent purchases (as long as they're below the budget threshold you have), they'd be done in the background. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I'm pretty sure we have that working in the client code in JavaScript... if we don't, it's easy to add. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Most of what we would need is the infrastructure for the demo itself... [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  i have a question about the message</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  it's talking about paid apps, does that mean app stores like phone apps or webapsp</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i think he's talking about webapps not mobile apps</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  but it could work for both, but i don't think that's what he wants</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we have had three groups approach us and ask how payswarm enables webapp stores</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the ability to sell an HTML5 webapp off of your website or a centralized webapp store</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we definitely support that use case</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we could also support an in-phone store app, but we don't have the code to demonstrate that just yet</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  so the webapp store use case would look like our recipes demo now?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i think so, but it could extend further to show how to buy extra lives/equipment/whatever for say, an HTML5 game that you originally bought simple access to</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so there are two things:</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  access to the webapp and the other is in-app purchases</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  it doesn't sound like it's a stretch to come up with a demo for that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  i'm wondering if there's some existing demo we could leverage</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if we could wrap an opensource game and hook it up to the fake money development site</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  to show granting access to the game and also show buying say, extra lives within the game when you die</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it's the equivalent of an arcade style model</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so i'm hearing that we can help melvin with this and that it wouldn't be a distraction as it's a demo we've always wanted to do</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  i agree</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so we'll ping melvin and see what kind of help he needs to build this demo</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we can make the demo open source and host it on a subdomain on payswarm.com (eg: games.payswarm.com) or something like that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  i think it would be faster to spin up a demo in node than PHP</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  ok, we can get our current release out and then try to help melvin out on the demo</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  ok, next topic then</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Client-side Asset/Listing publishing process</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  hitting .well-known for the payswarm config and the webkeys will give you the payswarm and webkeys end points</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yeah, I think that's what we want to do. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so, publishing an asset for sale</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the link to the source is in IRC ... there's a lot of boilerplate in there</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yeah, the information in the config file is something that you don't want to keep repeating over and over again. It's in the config file so that they don't have to keep typing it over and over again. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  publishing an asset for sale is a 3 step process</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so you first need to create the asset and digitally sign it with your previously generated private key</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  When we say things like "You have to digitally sign the asset", we mean that there is a call to the payswarm client... payswarm.sign(). No highly technical details that folks need to get into, they just use the method that's provided. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the asset is what you want to sell and the listing indicates the pricing for it, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  People using the API don't need to get into any of the technical details about what's happening with the crypto stuff. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the listing also indicates the license that the asset is being sold under</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">...creating the asset is step 1, creating the listing is step 2</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">...and step 3 is publishing that asset and listing ...</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">...which can be done on your own website</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and that listing is decentralized, it can be distributed from anywhere</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the asset and listing are identified by a URL</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and anyone can pass them around as they are digitally-signed, you can get them from anywhere, but they typically just live at their URLs</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so we create an asset, a listing, and then publish them</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L84">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L84</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  then a purchasing client can just grab them from the URL and do a purchase.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so let's go through the code briefly</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  first a config is read in and then we create an asset</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the asset is created as JSON-LD, which really is just JSON</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we say that the asset's type is an asset and a webpage, we use an product ontology to mark it up as a webpage</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the creator of the asset is just the person who created the asset</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we give the title for the asset and the URL where the asset content can be found, and the provider of the asset, which is the asset's owner</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and that's all the basic information for an asset</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  but because we're using JSON-LD you can extend this however you'd like</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  you can put whatever vocabulary terms in there you want and it will be digitally-signed</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and custom applications can display that extra information or do something with it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  tracking numbers/other details, whatever they want can be added to the asset</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and payswarm authorities will keep that information around and include it in digital contracts</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L102">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L102</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  next the asset is passed off to the signature call</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and the payswarm client does an RSA signature on the JSON-LD object</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  you give it the object to be signed (the asset) and your private key pem and your public key ID which is a URL to your public key</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that way anyone can fetch your public key and check the signature on the asset</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L107">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L107</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  next we hash the asset, and the reason we do that is so that the listing doesn't have to repeat the asset itself</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  The asset hash is important because when you want to sell something, you're going to assign a price to it. There is a possibility that your asset will change over time. When you create your listing, you want to be very specific about the asset you're selling. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  You don't want somebody to come along and say that you promised to sell them something for $0.05, and you've changed the asset to be worth much more than that. It protects sellers against people claiming that they promised to sell them something they didn't. It's an assurance against situations where the asset changes. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L113">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L113</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we take the asset hash and include that in the listing</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  which we generate next in step 2</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the listing has a validity period just like say, SSL certificates have</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this is so that people can offer something for sale but they aren't bound forever to offer that asset for sale forever</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so if a merchant wants to change their price every week or day then they'll generate their listing using that validity period (one week/one day)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  they can use whatever makes sense for them</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the listing also has an ID which is a URL</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the type is a ps:Listing (a payswarm Listing) and it's also a good-relations offering</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we might not keep that around in our example, but it isn't part of the spec, just like with the asset you can add additional markup</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the listing contains the list of people that should be paid (payees) when an asset is sold</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  payees are associated with financial accounts and indicate some amount of money that should be paid to those accounts</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Payee position is important - you specify a rate and a rate type. rate can be a flat amount - rate type will be flat amount. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  There are also exclusive percentages and inclusive percentages for rate types. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  So, there are cases where you want to use exclusive percentage - sales tax falls into this category. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  inclusive percentages allow vendors to take a cut of the total price... so 2% of $2. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  These calculations are affected by where you put the payee in the list. When we talk about payees, we are talking about people that should get paid... not necessarily how much they will get paid (that amount is calculated) [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  When you put your listing up for sale, you don't have to know about which PaySwarm authority is going to process your payment. This is where payee rules come in... you can limit who takes a cut of the sale like this. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  For example, you can limit how much a payswarm authority takes for processing your asset - this is good because it's a really decentralized way of who gets the money, and makes sure that the people running the transactions are very much decoupled from who is getting paid. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  All of this happens before you having to talk to every payswarm authority out there... you just publish the listing, If people want the listing, and the payswarm authority wants to process the listing - you will get paid. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We're trying to take a decentralized, free-market approach to this. There are no centralized parties controlling this stuff. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this also allows people to set up a rogue payswarm authority that says "oh yeah, a person paid for this" to trick software into giving people access that shouldn't have access, however, there is a protection against this built into the system</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  you, as a vendor/merchant, specifically say which authorities you trust</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and you can use a whitelist for this (only trust authorities A, B, C) or just blacklist those that you think are misbehaving</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we expect there to be a whitelist</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We have to make sure where we avoid problems in the future where PaySwarm Authorities get shut out... if somebody wants to start a new payswarm authority, if they're legit and acting in good faith, they need to get on that list. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and that whitelist could be centralized and well known</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We don't want the case where good PAs are not allowed onto the list. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and managed automatically similar to how browsers deal with certificate authorities</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  one way we could deal with payswarm authorities getting shut out could be by having the w3c manage the white list ... such that if you pass a test suite and pass some good "karma" system you'd get onto the whitelist automatically</div>
<div class="information">so payees say who gets paid and payee rules say what restrictions apply to additional payees</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L127">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L127</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  in this demo we can see that there is just one payee and the destination is the account of the person digitally signing the listing (the vendor/merchant)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the rate is the price that was set earlier in the program and the rate type is a flat amount</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the rate is $0.05 here, so that's what the payee will get on sale</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L136">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L136</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the payee comment just displays some test information</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the payee rule places limitations on additional payees</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this particular rule says that a payswarm authority can take up to 10% of your sale if they want to for processing it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this assumes that payswarm authorities must not run this transaction through and take 12%</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  they must limit themselves to be a valid payswarm authority (and to get onto that whitelist)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the payswarm authority must be a trusted party</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the listing next says what the asset is and then what the license is</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the license can say all kinds of things (it's text) and say "you can do X things with this asset Y times" or whatever you'd like</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it can simply say it's a direct ownership change, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the license hash works the same way as the asset hash</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  to ensure that you're linking to the license you think you are</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L151">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L151</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  then the listing is signed, just like the asset was</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  In case anybody has a question about what happens when a PaySwarm Authority looks up the license and the hash? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  The PA will report that it's a bad listing if the licenseHash doesn't match the license. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  right, if any of the hashes dont' match, a purchase process will be aborted</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L159">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm.js/blob/master/examples/publish-asset-for-sale.js#L159</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  <a href="http://listings.dev.payswarm.com/">http://listings.dev.payswarm.com/</a> exists for demo purposes, and the final step registers the asset/listing combo there. However, you can publish to anywhere on the Web that you have write access to. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we support both RDFa and JSON-LD</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We will want to say that at a minimum, you'll want to support RDFa and maybe JSON-LD. Other PAs could support stuff like XML, but they won't be inter-operable. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so here we just post the asset and the listing to a URL where they'll be published</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  keep in mind that this is a non-HTTPS site, it's just HTTP</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and the nice thing about payswarm is that this isn't an issue because the asset and listing are digitally signed</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so they can't be forged here and still result in a valid purchase</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  The way this could be mitigated is that the vendor could just revoke their key... then all listings signed using the key would become invalidated. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if a vendor mis-signs an listing with a very low price for say, a long validity period like a year</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yes, key revocation is the best solution for this. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so once you've published your asset/listing to a webpage, that's it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  and that covers the process for making something available for sale</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the actual code to do this is pretty minimal (we've got some other stuff in there to make the demo run nicely, etc)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  you don't need much knowledge to do this either</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yes, so pretty simple process - generate asset, generate listing, digitally sign them, publish them to the Web... then you're selling via PaySwarm. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
