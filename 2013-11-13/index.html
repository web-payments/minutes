<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: Update from W3C TPAC</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Ok, so we've been getting a ton of exposure at W3C TPAC 2013.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: I've been going around to the various Working Groups that are working on stuff related to what we're doing and have been introducing the work we're doing in the Web Payments group.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: There have been a number of people from large organizations that have come up to me to talk about where we are and where we expect the work to go. All good interactions for the most part.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: The first group I presented at was the Broadcast Interest Group, which is a group of broadcasters that are interested in the Web as a delivery mechanism. They were interested because they want to sell broadcast content over the Web. I invited them to the breakout session we had today and a number of them came.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: The second group was the Digital Publishing Interest Group, who basically give input to other Working Groups to tell them what they need to work on to make digital publishing more prevalent using Web technologies. They care about selling eBooks and digital written content, so they were interested in the Web Payments work. It was mild interest because most of what the group does has to do w/ </div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: display of eBooks using Web browsers.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: The third group was the Systems Applications Working Group, who are working on the Secure Element API. We're interested in their work because there are a number of hardware devices that are capable of doing digital signatures and identity authentication using the Secure Element API (either via contact pin/chip chards or contactless NFC).</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: I also spent time talking w/ Mark Nottingham (Chair of HTTPbis Working Group) about HTTP/2.0 and the HTTP Security spec, and hope to follow up with him on that later this week.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: I had a meeting with W3C Management to coordinate how we're going to run the upcoming workshop on Web Payments next March, during the last week of that month in Paris.</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: W3C TPAC Breakout Session on Web Payments</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Most of the time on Monday and Tuesday was spent trying to build support for the Web Payments Breakout session today.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: I was expecting only around 7-10 people to come to the workshop. We had 25 people show up, with around another 8 that wanted to make it but couldn't due to conflicts.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: The minutes for that meeting can be found here: <a href="https://payswarm.com/minutes/2013-11-13-workshop/">https://payswarm.com/minutes/2013-11-13-workshop/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: So, the workshop went fairly well.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: We had good attendance, I did a quick 15 minute-ish overview and then opened the floor up to questions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: There was a mix of electronics manufacturers (Toshiba, Samsung, LG, Nokia), payment processors (PayPal, PayGate, Positron), mobile operators (Telefonica, Orange), television/broadcasters/media companies (TBS, WOWOW), and security companies (Gemalto)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: there was also someone from the National Association of Convenience Stores, who process lots and lots of credit cards.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: So, we had almost every group that we'd want to have in a Working Group in the room. The only people we were missing were people from government, but W3C is fairly light in that area.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: There was a lot to cover and not enough time, but we got some very good discussion done in the time we had. Most of the concern was around creating a solution that didn't disadvantage or advantage any particular player.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: For example, PayPal was very concerned about the browser vendors being unfairly advantaged. They were also concerned about mobile operators being advantaged.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: There was concern around there being a full stack (PaySwarm) proposed instead of a discussion before the fact. I tried to make it clear that PaySwarm is just a proposal and emboidies the type of stuff we'd like to do in the group. However, it's just meant as a starting point and we'd modify the specs to pull in other technologies, or if another member has a better technology, we'd use that </div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: instead.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: The end result was a clear demonstration of support for the Workshop in Paris, so that was a really good outcome.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Any questions on this before we move on?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: nope</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Web Payments Workshop</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Ok, so I had a number of discussions with Dave Raggett, who has been assigned by W3C to make the Workshop in Paris happen.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: He's pretty thinly spread at the moment, so we need to help him if we don't want to risk the workshop slipping more than it has already.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: This means getting two chairs for the workshop as well as a program committee together.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: We have already secured the primary chair for the workshop as of this past Tuesday. He just needs to get clearance from his company's management and we'll be able to announce who he is shortly.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: We have contacted two other organizations to send a chair and someone for the program committee.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: We should hear something back by the end of this week.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: The chairs are responsible for ensuring that the agenda runs smoothly for the workshop during the 1.5 days of the workshop.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: The program committee is responsible for reviewing paper submissions and getting their colleagues at other institutions to attend the workshop.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: It's very important to strike the right balance when it comes to program committee participants. We need people from each segment of industry that we've identified - electronics, payment processors, mobile operators, television, security, and retail.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: We will need around 15-20 people on the program committee.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: and we need to have that done by the end of this month (November 2013). We already have 7 people on the program committee. We'll need to get the rest in place by end of November and we'll need to send out the Call for Papers/Positions by early December.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: The reason we're in a rush is that we need to provide at least two months for people to get papers together.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: and with the holidays fast approaching, those weeks aren't going to be enough for people to write papers, arrange travel, and invite colleagues.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: We have a space for 100 people max. We need to get at least 30-50 to demonstrate any sort of legitimacy wrt. creating a Working Group at W3C.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: That we were able to get so many people into a breakout session is a good sign, now we need to build on that momentum.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Any questions on any of this?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: not from me</div>
<h1 id="topic-4" class="topic">Topic: The Rest of W3C TPAC</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: For the next two days, I'll be meeting w/ the rest of the Working Groups that are affected by our work, or whose work we'll depend on. These include the Near-Field Communication Working Group, the Web Crypto Working Group, and the Web and Mobile Interest Group.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: There are also around 10 other people that have requested private meetings or hallway discussions related to Web Payments and how it affects their organizations.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: So, I'll also be talking with those folks in an attempt to get them folded into the group.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Alright, that's all I have as far as an update is concerned. I probably missed a few discussions, but the general take-away is that people are responding very well to the goals of this group and how we're approaching the problem.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Any questions? If not, let's adjourn.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: nope</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: ok, good 'cause it's 1am here and I want to go to sleep :P</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: :)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>: too busy scribing to have questions :)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: no doubt.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: bye bye, see you guys in 5-ish days!</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: yes, looking forward to it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>: As you are talking to all these people, might want to ask how they want to participate.  Showing up to these sorts of telecons doesn't seem to be what they want to do.  Should more stuff be done on the mailing list?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: It's a bit early to ask them  how they want to participate... they're just trying to get their mind wrapped around the stuff we're doing.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: I did meet Mountie Lee and Anders Rudgren in person here.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Both said that they'd like to participate in more telecons.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>: Ok.  It's understandable if it's difficult to show up to these things.  I was just wondering what other communication methods we could use.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: We're using the standard methods that most other groups use.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: The problem at this point seems to be one of: 1) people don't know we exist and 2) when they do find out about us, they don't know if it affects them, and 3) if it does affect them, they don't know what they can contribute to.</div>
