<div class="information">Slides for presentation by Jeff Jaffe: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/slides/intro_jeff_jaffe.pdf">http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/slides/intro_jeff_jaffe.pdf</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  The W3C was founded by the inventor of the WWW, Tim Berners-Lee.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Earlier this month, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the WWW.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We have a very simple, mission statement - lead the web to it&apos;s full potential.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We have a pretty good track record of that. We&apos;re a member-based organization. We have govts, startups, technology companies, non profits, close to 400 members.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Large commercial companies. The community that we have are the entire users of the WWW, we&apos;re shooting for entire planet.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  For technical standards, we&apos;re larger than most technical standards - 70 people spread around the world, we want architectural coherance for the Web.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Outputs we produce are available to everyone.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  UbiWeb - ubiquitous Web, We work on Web accessibility.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  No one with disabilities should be prevented from using the Web.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Information and Knowledge focuses on data.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Each piece of technology gets created in a WG. Most of the work is done by engineers from member organizations, sometimes we have invited experts from outside.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We work w/ Internet Engineering Task Force, we interface w/ who we need to.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We have a royalty-free patent policy. When Tim invented the Web, he made it available to the world. If you have an invention that belongs in the core of the Web, and  you have a patent, that should be available on a royalty-free basis.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Some of you may be familiar w/ de jure standards. We have a fast-track for de jure international standards.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  As the Web has become more important, large companies have been joining.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We also have been trying to get smaller companies in. There is a new track of work - once community decides that something needs to be a Web Standard, we did a good job.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  However, we didn&apos;t do well in pre-standardization work.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  So, innovators would get together to do pre-standardization work. So, we created a new track called Community Groups. It made pre-standardization work easier. Sometimes CGs are discussion groups.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We have around 170 CGs, close to 4,000 engineers working in these groups.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We are working on the &quot;Open Web Platform&quot;, lots of people doing work, but at the end of the day it all has to come together. We use &quot;open web platform&quot; to differentiate the open web from the web of 25 years ago.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  In 25 years, the Web has become much more. Increasingly, the Web is not the end result, it&apos;s a platform for other applications to build on top of it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  The platform for building distributed applications - it&apos;s very interactive. It&apos;s characterized by Rich Interactive Media. The content was exciting, but it was fairly static. Now web pages are exciting (lots of great fonts, media, images, etc.)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We&apos;re working on HTML5 and CSS3 now, two hallmarks of W3C standardization work.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  The span of devices implementing the Web has been expanding. In last 10 years, we&apos;ve successfuly moved the Web to the smartphone, it&apos;s a design point for the Web.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Web and automotive is new work we&apos;re doing. So is mobile.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Web technology runs most everywhere,</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Secure Web Platform - it&apos;s important that we keep innovating.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  New industries that are affected - mobile, entertainment, gaming, healthcare, digital publishing, all are increasingly getting affected.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Digital publishing is interesting, we&apos;ve been publishing for a while now. Mass distribution on a global scale, everyone is an author. Very different from highly selective publishing houses.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Web lacked quality of publishing for a long time. Font selection, styling, you couldn&apos;t do any of that. However, today we&apos;re in a situation we know how to achieve all of that technically.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  As publishing was changed after Web, so do other industries.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  With the Web Payments workshop, we&apos;re launching what could be a more fundamental transformation. It&apos;ll be impactful,  not sure how it&apos;ll turn out.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Lots of stuff is bought on the Web :)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Payments for mobile devices are increasing, searching for new ways of providing  payments on the Web.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  If the Open Web Platform has been successful, to be the reference standard for what gets done in those industries, let&apos;s explore how the Web affects payments.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We wouldn&apos;t be exploring this if payments were simple.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  For most people, it&apos;s bewildering to do payments on the Web (to pay for things).</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  To set something up the first time, it&apos;s difficult.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We have cryptocurrencies coming up, it&apos;s part of the whole picture. The complexity of the ecosystem is something we&apos;re going to be focusing on.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Merchants are a part of the picture. When you want to set yourself up on the Web, you have to figure out how you&apos;re going to get payments accessible to your customers.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  With Web Applications, the number of people that are trying to monetize things on the Web is growing exponentially.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Prakash Hariramani</span>: With web applications, number of people who are trying to navigate the web has increased substantially</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  I want to do a one-off purchase, it&apos;s not easy.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  A regular Amazon user has no problem, but we want a frictionless approach where anyone can buy from anyone in an easy fashion. The user experience should be simple. Not tons of passwords for each site that I frequent.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  High levels of fraud, the overall security of the system - it&apos;s not great. We all worry that one day it&apos;s going to get worse.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Prakash Hariramani</span>: Lack of standardization = Poor and variable user experience across sites and across payment systems</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Is it really secure enough?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Payments should be easy</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  People should be able to pay how they want to. If I have a smartphone, or tablet - I&apos;d like a single &quot;wallet&quot; and do things consistently among devices.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Transparency is important -transaction fees should be clear.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  How does this get done technically? Unsure, that&apos;s why we&apos;re having this workshop.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We&apos;re going to figure out where to do standardization. Maybe this happens at W3C, maybe somewhere else.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  What to standardize is a very delicate choice.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  We have the open web platform, having a clean way of getting a request for payments, proof of payments is standardization candidate.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Having a standard interface between browser/wallet is a good standardization candidate.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Interfacing w/ external payment providers is important.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Being able to select payment mechanism is important... we need to manage this complexity.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Users should have greater choices, more choices, more consistency. There is enough automation/verification that merchants should be able to trust customers.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  W3C is a consensus organization, we bring stakeholders together. We bring them together to try and figure out the best way to address some of these issues.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  The Web is a global mechanism, we need things to work across borders. We want an open and level playing field.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  When we start to look at a complex problem, we fail if we try to solve the  entire problem at once.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  So, what&apos;s the lowest hanging fruit.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  What makes a workshop successful - enter it w/ a spirit of openness.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  There are many things related to technology and payments - we&apos;re focused on technology issues and enablement. Standards are a human activity.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Jaffe</span>:  Let&apos;s start talking and seeking consensus.</div>

<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Introduction from Alexander Gee, European Commission</h1>
<div class="information">Slides for presentation by Alexander Gee, Deputy Head of the Payments Unit for the European Commission&apos;s DG Competition: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/slides/gee.pdf">http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/slides/gee.pdf</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  I&apos;ve been doing payments since 2008.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  We welcome what&apos;s being done here. Anything that makes payment on the Web better, we&apos;d welcome anything that would expect the single market from the EU.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  What I&apos;d like to do now is simply go through  - explain what we&apos;re doing.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  My slides are detailed, so I&apos;ll skip through slides relatively quickly.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Payments in EU - epayments are largely card based. As far as EU is concerned, payments is 1% of GDP</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  It&apos;s 25% of bank revenues.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Card transactions have grown from 7.4% to 17.4% - price for accepting card payments is not reflecting scale and increased efficiency.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  DG Competition has focused on interchange fees. This is one of the biggest barriers to competition in payments market.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  We have been embroiled in a legal debate for years. MasterCard has said they&apos;d move interchange fees down 0.2% to 0.3%. They&apos;re around 1% right now.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Visa says they&apos;ll match Mastercard&apos;s fees.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Lower fees - markets segmented between national markets.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  We are now continuing w/ cases against MasterCard and Visa - regarding international payments.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  With interchange fees at this level, merchant is indifferent on getting paid w/ cash vs. card. We don&apos;t have enough info on what a good comparator is for epayments.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Direct debits of credit transfers would be good. Offline figures would be good.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  We&apos;ve carried out a detailed study - 0.2% or 0.3% seems reasonable.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Normal standardization is pro-competitive, but we&apos;ve found that major players have banded together to create an exclusionary effect on non-bank epayment mechanisms.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  In Netherlands, more internet-based payments are made than card-based ones.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Non-bank players were excluded - the way standardization was being done - it was exclusionary.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  We tried to work w/ European Payments Council .</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Interchange fees are a way to pass fees onto customers in a way that they can&apos;t see them.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  New entrants to innovation - atms / internet banking, paypal, payfair, monnet, ideal and Mybank, sofort.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Paypal is more expensive than card payments [scribe assist by Prakash Hariramani]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  From our point of view, Paypal is expensive - more expensive than card payments. It&apos;s a closed system. You have to establish a new account w them.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Virginie Galindo</span>: Payfair : <a href="http://www.payfair.eu/">http://www.payfair.eu/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Monnet replaced national schemes, but it failed, they were willing to offer 0.2%-0.3%, they wanted to match fees elsehewre in EU (not in France)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  If they didn&apos;t do these higher fees, they were taking much more risk.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Systems in Italy - click directly on bank via credit transfer.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Recently proposed regulation - we want to create a level playing field - it can&apos;t be done by competition enforcement.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  It cannot act very fast - mastercard case took 7 years.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Competition enforcement cannot act fast/last mover advantage [scribe assist by Prakash Hariramani]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  So, we want to create a legal base for non-banks - third party providers.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  So, here&apos;s the proposal:</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Promote consumer welfare - reduce excessive fees.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Increase choice</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Promote competition, efficiences should be passed on to consumers.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  We want to reduce barriers for competition and increase transparency, reduce barriers to entry.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Reducing interchange fees - Monnet and PayFair - they cannot enter the market because banks are expecting a similar revenue.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Banks are keen to have more expensive card payments schemes, so we need to work on that.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  The commission proposes - regulate the fees of &quot;Must take&quot; cards - 4 party schemes, consumer visa/mastercard card.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  National schemes problematic</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Immediately cap the fees for cross-border transactions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Promote the idea of a single market - 2 years delay on national/domestic transactions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  More effectively functioning cards market -</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  What we can do:</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Allow merchants to refuse cards</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Provide a legal base for 3rd party providers - supervise licensing, make sure their presence in the market is secure - supervised/licensed, identify themselves, limit access to minimum necessary.</div>
<div class="information">The scribe missed the content of slide 13</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  No strong confidential data, need strong authentication.</div>
<div class="information">State of play regarding proposal.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  EU Parliment voted in 20 Feb 2014. MIF caps after 1 year, 7 cent max debit fee</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Caps should also cover commercial cards.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Cross-border acquiring at rate of acquirer&apos;s country.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Ongoing work on Greek Presidency, under Italian presidency in Italy.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Eric Tak</span>:  Considering that fees were identified are also being used online - does that mean it&apos;s a basis for services like MyBank to consider?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  No, under competition rules, we have the obligatin to say that there is a problem. They can always come forward w/ efficiency arguments. They&apos;ll find it difficult to do.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  So, I don&apos;t see what efficiency arguments they could bring forward.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Birch</span>:  I don&apos;t see what the principle of the regulation is?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Birch</span>:  Since the DG Competition has been doing this for a decade - and there is no new competition. I don&apos;t get what you&apos;re doing?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to say nothing &quot;new&quot; has happened, there have been new things.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Birch</span>:  You can only use it in the Netherlands, it&apos;s not effective!</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  There is so much money floating around in this system, banks have not wanted to comply w/ competition law. Mastercard has made no attempt to do anthing other than bare necessary changes.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Visa has always made changes at very last section. We haven&apos;t seen lowering of interchange fees. It takes a very long time to force people to do it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Regulatory approach is necessary. If we enforce lower interchange fees, we might be able to do something about it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Hannes Tschofenig</span>:  In Jeff&apos;s talk - he said we should have more user choice. Been working on identity - there&apos;s an interesting pattern. Little choice w/ identity providers on internet.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Hannes Tschofenig</span>:  Identity providers layering payment on top. How do we provide more user choice? To prevent us from using 3 payment providers that are going to be US companies.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Regulators have a hard time leading the market.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Appelquist</span>: Some side discussion going on here kicked off my my comment on http 402 status code and also link rel=payment (see <a href="http://relpayment.com)">http://relpayment.com)</a> : https://twitter.com/torgo/status/448016153869574145</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Danish market - banks operating through banking association - NETSID - ID system used by danish banks - used for online gaming.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Way of verifying that people are over 18.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  This is the only recognized system - banks have used this power to kick out new entrants. This is a difficult area for regulators to get involved in.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Charles McCathie Nevile</span>:  Two questions - in 3rd party providers - they&apos;re not allowed to store confidential data? What kind and why? Isn&apos;t there a risk that if you silo off EU as a limited income space, won&apos;t they just jack up the prices for the rest of the world? Isn&apos;t that what they do?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Second question first, this is an argument that we often hear from the banks / card schemes. What we see is that we&apos;re moving away from hidden fees to fees people can see.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  System of transparent pricing - see what happened in US - Durbin amendment - banks said that they want to increase card payment fees, found that they couldn&apos;t do it - people didn&apos;t want it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Banks would like to say - we want to raise fees - they will be constrained by market opportunities. If they could raise them, they&apos;d have already done it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Charles McCathie Nevile</span>:  There is a difference between transparency and caps on pricing.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  In this case, we&apos;re capping the part that customers can&apos;t see</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Charles McCathie Nevile</span>:  Trusted Third Parties (TPP&apos;s) and why can&apos;t they hold data?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  The concern is that payment providers can hold your data and get back into your bank account.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  That should not be possible, there should be a transactional business model. You leave no trace w/ the TPP.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Alexander Gee</span>:  Minimize risks - they need to keep basic info on transaction.</div>
