08:13:12 <m4nu> Jeff: We have a royalty-free patent policy. When Tim invented the Web, he made it available to the world. If you have an invention that belongs in the core of the Web, and  you have a patent, that should be available on a royalty-free basis.
08:13:34 <m4nu> Jeff: Some of you may be familiar w/ de-jure standards. We have a fast-path track for DeJure international standards.
08:13:58 <m4nu> Jeff: As the Web has become more important, large companies have been joining.
08:14:29 <m4nu> Jeff: We also have been trying to get smaller companies in. There is a new track of work - once community decides that something needs to be a Web Standard, we did a good job.
08:14:39 <m4nu> Jeff: However, we didn't do well in pre-standardization work.
08:15:23 <m4nu> Jeff: So, innovators would get together to do pre-standardization work. So, we created a new track called Community Groups. It made pre-standardization work easier. Sometimes CGs are discussion groups.
08:15:36 <m4nu> Jeff: We have around 170 CGs, close to 4,000 engineers working in these groups.

08:16:18 <m4nu> Jeff: We are working on the "Open Web Platform", lots of people doing work, but at the end of the day it all has to come together. We use "open web platform" to differentiate the open web from the web of 25 years ago.
08:16:49 <m4nu> Jeff: In 25 years, the Web has become much more. Increasingly, the Web is not the end result, it's a platform for other applications to build on top of it.

08:17:41 <m4nu> Jeff: The platform for building distributed applications - it's very interactive. It's characterized by Rich Interactive Media. The content was exciting, but it was fairly static. Now web pages are exciting (lots of great fonts, media, images, etc.)
08:17:58 <m4nu> Jeff: We're working on HTML5 and CSS3 now, two hallmarks of W3C standardization work.
08:18:04 <chaals> s/glazou: close to the number of prrson in the amphi//
08:18:23 <m4nu> Jeff: The span of devices implementing the Web has been expanding. In last 10 years, we've successfuly moved the Web to the smartphone, it's a design point for the Web.
08:18:42 <m4nu> Jeff: Web and automotive is new work we're doing. So is mobile.
08:18:47 <chaals> present+ prakash, VirginieG, JeffJaffe, WendySeltzer
08:18:50 <m4nu> Jeff: Web technology runs most everywhere,
08:19:03 <m4nu> Jeff: Secure Web Platform - it's important that we keep innovating.

08:20:23 <m4nu> Jeff: Digital publishing is interesting, we've been publishing for a while now. Mass distribution on a global scale, everyone is an author. Very different from highly selective publishing houses.
08:20:57 <m4nu> Jeff: Web lacked quality of publishing for a long time. Font selection, styling, you couldn't do any of that. However, today we're in a situation we know how to achieve all of that technically.
08:21:15 <prakash> prakash has joined #W3Cpayment
08:21:28 <m4nu> Jeff: As publishing was changed after Web, so do other industries.
08:21:47 <m4nu> Jeff: With the Web Payments workshop, we're launching what could be a more fundamental transformation. It'll be impactful,  now sure how it'll turn out.
08:22:00 <m4nu> Jeff: Lots of stuff is bought on the Web :)
08:22:14 <m4nu> Jeff: Payments for mobile devices are increasing, searching for new ways of providing  payments on the Web.
08:22:40 <m4nu> Jeff: If the Open Web Platform has been successful, to be the reference standard for what gets done in those industries, let's explore how the Web affects payments.
08:22:54 <m4nu> Jeff: We wouldn't be exploring this if payments were simple.
08:23:10 <m4nu> Jeff: For most people, it's bewildering to do payments on the Web (to pay for things).
08:23:22 <m4nu> Jeff: To set something up the first time, it's difficult.
08:23:45 <phariramani> phariramani has joined #W3Cpayment
08:23:47 <m4nu> Jeff: We have cryptocurrencies coming up, it's part of the whole picture. The complexity of the ecosystem is something we're going to be focusing on.
08:23:48 <ThomasPicard_ALU> ThomasPicard_ALU has joined #W3CPayment
08:24:11 <m4nu> Jeff: merchants are a part of the picture. When you want to set yourself up on the Web, you have to figure out how you're going to get payments accessible to your customers.
08:24:27 <m4nu> jeff: With Web Applications, the number of people that are trying to monetize things on the Web is growing exponentially.
08:24:33 <phariramani> With web applications, number of people who are trying to navigate the web has increased substantially

08:24:42 <m4nu> Jeff: I want to do a one-off purchase, it's not easy.
08:25:17 <m4nu> Jeff: A regular Amazon user has no problem, but we want a frictionless approach where anyone can buy from anyone in an easy fashion. The user experience should be simple. Not tons of passwords for each site that I frequent.
08:25:33 <m4nu> Jeff: High levels of fraud, the overall security of the system - it's not great. We all worry that one day it's going to get worse.
08:25:35 <phariramani> Lack of standardization = Poor and variable user experience across sites and across payment systems
08:25:44 <m4nu> Jeff: Is it really secure enough?
08:25:48 <m4nu> Jeff: payments should be easy
08:26:22 <m4nu> jeff: People should be able to pay how they want to. If I have a smartphone, or tablet - I'd like a single "wallet" and do things consistently among devices.
08:26:31 <m4nu> Jeff: Transparency is important -transaction fees should be clear.
08:26:54 <m4nu> jeff: How does this get done technically? Unsure, that's why we're having this workshop.

08:27:07 <Tim> Tim has joined #W3CPayment
08:27:11 <m4nu> Jeff: We're going to figure out where to do standardization. Maybe this happens at W3C, maybe somewhere else.
08:27:25 <chaals> s/we need link for current presentation of Jeffe//
08:27:26 <m4nu> Jeff: What to standardize is a very delicate choice.
08:28:03 <m4nu> Jeff: We have the open web platform, having a clean way of getting a request for payments, proof of payments is standardization candidate.
08:28:18 <m4nu> Jeff: having a standard interface between browser/wallet is a good standardization candidate.
08:28:36 <m4nu> Jeff: Interfacing w/ external payment providers is important.

08:31:03 <m4nu> Jeff: The Web is a global mechanism, we need things to work across borders. We want an open and level playing field.
08:31:27 <m4nu> Jeff: When we start to look at a complex problem, we fail if we try to solve the  entire problem at once.

08:35:01 <m4nu> Alexander: What I'd like to do now is simply go through  - explain what we're doing.

08:35:58 <m4nu> Alexander: Payments in EU - epayments are largely card based. As far as Eu is concerned, payments is 1% of GDP
08:36:06 <jeff> jeff has joined #w3cpayment
08:36:06 <m4nu> Alexander: It's 25% of bank revenues.
08:36:44 <m4nu> Alexander: card transactions have grown from 7.4% to 17.4% - price for accepting card payments is not reflecting scale and increased efficiency.
08:37:05 <m4nu> Alexander: DG Competition has focused on interchange fees. This is one of the biggest barriers to competition in payments market.
08:37:56 <m4nu> Alexander: We have been embroiled in a legal debate for years. MasterCard has said they'd move interchange fees down 0.2% to 0.3%. They're around 1% right now.
08:38:10 <m4nu> Alexander: Visa says they'll match Mastercard's fees.
08:38:37 <m4nu> Alexander: Lower fees - markets segmented between national markets.

08:38:59 <m4nu> Alexander: We are now continuing w/ cases against MasterCard and Visa - regarding international payments.
08:39:49 <m4nu> Alexander: with interchange fees at this level, merchant is indifferent on getting paid w/ cash vs. card. We don't have enough info on what a good comparator is for epayments.
08:40:17 <m4nu> Alexander: Direct debits of credit transfers would be good. Offline figures would be good.
08:40:33 <Angie> Angie has joined #w3cpayment
08:40:46 <m4nu> Alexander: We've carried out a detailed study - 0.2% or 0.3% seems reasonable.
08:41:44 <m4nu> Alexander: Normal standardization is pro-competitive, but we've found that major players have banded together to create an exclusionary effect on non-bank epayment mechanisms.
08:42:20 <m4nu> Alexander: In Netherlands, more internet-based payments are made than card-based ones.
08:42:51 <m4nu> Alexander: Non-bank players were excluded - the way standardization was being done - it was exclusionary.

08:45:20 <m4nu> Alexander: New entrants to innovation - atms / internet banking, paypal, payfair, monnet, ideal and Mybank, sofort.
08:45:49 <phariramani> Alexander: Paypal is more expensive than card payments
08:45:52 <m4nu> Alexander: From our point of view, Paypal is expensive - more expensive than card payments. It's a closed system. You have to establish a new account w them.
08:46:26 <virginie> payfair : http://www.payfair.eu/
08:46:43 <m4nu> Alexander: Monnet replaced national schemes, but it failed, they were willing to offer 0.2%-0.3%, they wanted to match fees elsehewre in EU (not in France)
08:46:57 <chaals> present+ tobie
08:46:59 <m4nu> Alexander: If they didn't do these higher fees, they were taking much more risk.
08:47:26 <m4nu> Alexander: Systems in Italy - click directly on bank via credit transfer.
08:48:26 <m4nu> Alexander: Recently proposed regulation - we want to create a level playing field - it can't be done by competition enforcement.
08:48:39 <m4nu> Alexander: it cannot act very fast - mastercard case took 7 years.
08:48:49 <phariramani> Alexander: competition enforcement cannot act fast//last mover advantage
08:48:52 <m4nu> Alexander: So, we want to create a legal base for non-banks - third party providers.
08:49:21 <m4nu> Alexander: So, here's the proposal:
08:49:31 <m4nu> Alexander: Promote consumer welfare - reduce excessive fees.
08:49:34 <m4nu> Alexander: Increase choice
08:49:49 <m4nu> Alexander: Promote competition, efficiences should be passed on to consumers.
08:50:09 <m4nu> Alexander: We want to reduce barriers for competition and increase transparency, reduce barriers to entry.
08:50:37 <m4nu> Alexander: Reducing interchange fees - Monnet and PayFair - they cannot enter the market because banks are expecting a similar revenue.
08:51:00 <m4nu> Alexander: Banks are keen to have more expensive card payments schemes, so we need to work on that.
08:51:24 <m4nu> Alexander: the commission proposes - regulate the fees of "Must take" cards - 4 party schemes, consumer visa/mastercard card.
08:51:36 <m4nu> Alexander: National schemes are ???
08:51:50 <m4nu> Alexander: Immediately cap the fees for cross-border transactions.
08:52:08 <m4nu> Alexander: Promote the idea of a single market - 2 years delay on national/domestic transactions.
08:52:35 <m4nu> Alexander: More effectively functioning cards market -
08:52:45 <m4nu> Alexander: What we can do:
08:52:58 <m4nu> Aleander: Allow merchants to refuse cards, ... (missed)
08:53:38 <m4nu> Alexander: Provide a legal base for 3rd party providers - supervise licensing, make sure their presence in the market is secure - supervised/licensed, identify themselves, limit access to minimum necessary.
08:53:51 <m4nu> scribe missed slide 13
08:54:19 <m4nu> Alexander: No strong confidential data, need strong authentication.
08:54:28 <m4nu> State of play regarding proposal.
08:54:55 <m4nu> Alexander: EU Parliment voted in 20 Feb 2014. MIF caps after 1 year, 7 cent max debit fee
08:55:05 <m4nu> Alexander: Caps should also cover commercial cards.

08:55:53 <m4nu> Alexander: Ongoing work on Greek Presidency, undder Italian presidency in Italy.
08:56:37 <m4nu> Eric (from ING): Considerign that fees were identified are also being used online - does that mean it's a basis for services like MyBank to consider?
08:56:52 <Ven> Ven has joined #W3CPAYMENT
08:57:13 <m4nu> Alexander: No, under competition rules, we have the obligatin to say that there is a problem. They can always come forward w/ efficiency arguments. They'll find it difficult to do.
08:57:31 <m4nu> Alexander: So, I don't see what efficiency arguments they could bring forward.

08:58:43 <m4nu> Alexander: I don't think it's fair to say nothing "new" has happened, there have been new things.
08:59:01 <m4nu> Dave_Birch: you can't use it in the netherlands
08:59:42 <m4nu> Alexander: There is so much money floating around in this system, banks have not wanted to comply w/ competition law. Mastercard has made no attempt to do anthing other than bare necessary changes.
09:00:11 <m4nu> Alexander: Visa has always made changes at very last section. We haven't seen lowering of interchange fees. It takes a very long time to force people to do it.
09:00:31 <m4nu> Alexander: Regulatory approach is necessary. If we enforce lower interchange fees, we might be able to do something about it.

09:02:18 <m4nu> Hannes: Identity providers layering payment on top. How do we provide more user choice? To prevent us from using 3 payment providers that are going to be US companies.
09:02:25 <m4nu> Alexander: Regulators have a hard time leading the market.
09:02:36 <dka> Some side discussion going on here kicked off my my comment on http 402 status code and also link rel=payment (see http://relpayment.com) : https://twitter.com/torgo/status/448016153869574145
09:02:49 <m4nu> Alexander: Danish market - banks operating through banking association - NETSID - ID system used by danish banks - used for online gaming.
09:02:59 <m4nu> Alexander: Way of verifying that people are over 18.
09:03:31 <m4nu> Alexander: This is the only recognized system - banks have used this power to kick out new entrants. This is a difficult area for regulators to get involved in.
09:04:23 <m4nu> Chaals: Two questions - in 3rd party providers - they're not allowed to store confidential data? What kind and why? Isn't there a risk that if you silo off EU as a limited income space, won't they just jack up the prices for the rest of the world? Isn't that what they do?
09:05:03 <m4nu> Alexander: Second question first, this is an argument that we often hear from the banks / card schemes. What we see is that we're moving away from hidden fees to fees people can see.
09:05:38 <m4nu> Alexander: System of transparent pricing - see what happened in US - Durbin amendment - banks said that they want to increase card payment fees, found that they couldn't do it - people didn't want it.
09:06:02 <m4nu> Alexander: Banks would like to say - we want to raise fees - they will be constrained by market opportunities. If they could raise them, they'd have already done it.

09:06:54 <m4nu> Chaals: TPP's and why they can't hold data?
09:07:10 <m4nu> Alexander: The concern is that payment providers can hold your data and get back into your bank account.
09:07:28 <m4nu> Alexander: That should not be possible, there should be a transactional business model. You leave no trace w/ the TPP.
09:07:49 <m4nu> Alexander: Minimize risks - they need to keep basic info on transaction.
