<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  some discussion that came out of payments workshop</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2013Sep/0019.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2013Sep/0019.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  kumar has made a proposal</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  what moz has shipped on FxOS is an api called navigator.mozPay()</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  the goal was to use what existed on the web and add things that were missing</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  new concept of mobile OS built on the web, had to add things like battery API, and other things that access the phone</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  payments functionality was more elusive at the time, need a secure way to enter credentials, and work with carrier billing in addition to paying with a CC</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  we were also considering a federated payment system, not sure exactly what that would mean in practice</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  persona is a federated login, but that doesn&apos;t translate to the payments space, experimentation happened but it didn&apos;t go anywhere in this area</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  the first goal of mozPay was to fill in the gaps for payments functionality that doesn&apos;t exist today, the second goal would be federated payments on the web.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  it&apos;s just a proposal, not a decision.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  the crux is, mozPay() is hard to integrate for folks that already have their own payment flow</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  paypal for example</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  what we wanted to do now, is pull out some of the new functionality we&apos;ve added to the web, i.e. carrier billing, network information</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  all these things could be used by developers in there own way, pull out this functionality and expose it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  maybe you want the ability to send a silent API to your short code service to set up carrier billing</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  there is not a lot that we&apos;ve identified on the web that you can&apos;t already do, so these pieces are pretty minimal</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  zong is paypal&apos;s carrier billing, it works already on the web</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  I have a theory that the payswarm protocol works on the web today</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that&apos;s correct</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  interesting usecases could be enabled if it was built into the browser</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  concerned about mozilla&apos;s focus, wants moz to think about a decentralized model of payments for the web</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  at a high level, is there a desire at mozilla to see things like ripple and bitcoin continue to mature, is that interesting to mozilla&apos;s core mission?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  for sure, this is just an open discussion</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  we work out in the open, and we are working it out</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  but we don&apos;t want to impose the JWT handshake if it&apos;s not going to get used or be useful</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  maybe a better way emerges via bitcoin. would be great if that can be given a chance to be tested by the market</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  the web doesn&apos;t need anything new for those protocols to be tested</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  this can be done through agreement to use a given protocol</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  maybe vendors don&apos;t need to add things to the platform for this, and it becomes more a question of promoting a protocol</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  we are not dealing with PCI compliance right now</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  it&apos;s unclear how mozilla would push decentralized payments forward given it&apos;s not a financial institution</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I understand that, and those are very good points</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  we shouldn&apos;t impose a standard that hasn&apos;t been well tested, could slow down other efforts. putting it on the platform takes time to update devices with future versions</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  payswarm does follow design principles of Persona, must be implementable via shims, but over time we could build web apis into the browser</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  payswarm is built this way to allow quick iteration</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there is a way forward here without browser integration, want to make sure mozilla is still interested in participating in open payment platform discussions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  hopes Mozilla can be a champion for decentralized payments</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Travis Choma</span>:  Yeah, that makes sense. I think a lot of the questions here are what we&apos;re dealing with short term, vs. the long term vision. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the idea that the browser could execute a payment, with key for signing purchase request, one approach would be to fall back to web crypto api</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the other thing is that you can store the digital receipts in your browser, purchase history within the browser</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  browser could access parts of ecommerce sites based on transmitting receipts</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  avoids payment processors tracking purchasing behavior across sites</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  would be good to have digital receipts cached in the browser</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  payment tech in the browser deals with proof of purchase</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  in order for that to work, what is needed, is some sort of private key on the device, in FxOS and mobile devices is a usecase beyond payments, NFC as well. need a secure element in sims to enable private keys on the device</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  client side behavior should be possible with secure element</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there are multiple ways to solve this problem</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  doesn&apos;t know if the secure element is enough to address the proof of purchase mechanism</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  might need a web api to fetch from a remote receipt store</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  there is a more general purpose web api that is neeeded potentially for storing things securely on devices beyond payments</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  might need to be a user permission</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  perhaps a generic local object store, receipts, virtual goods, etc</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  hand waving territory, but the discussion is good</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the other major category is doing a purchase without internet connectivity, buy from vending machine over NFC</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the idea is the vending machine would have a local web server, and the mobile phone would get the proof of purchase and deliver it to the vending machine</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  getting into bitcoin territory</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  being able to do transactions offline and join the network later and reconcile</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we need to make sure we address the usecases</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  your point still stands, maybe we don&apos;t need this in the browser at the moment</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we want this generic as possible, so new innovations can happen outside of payments as well</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Erik Anderson</span>:  hi, back on the call, I have a background in crypto, happy to discuss offline</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Erik Anderson</span>:  you can try QR codes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  those require some sort of server, but that&apos;s fine, storing things on device is dangerous, agreed.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Erik Anderson</span>:  you need proof not only of receipt but also of identity</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  happy to discuss it online</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  hope to have a call next week, will be calling into Dubai</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  last questions?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Kumar McMillan</span>:  thanks for the clarifications of usecases</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Evan Schwartz</span>:  interested in talking about private key on device or in the browser</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  talking with the w3c about some of this at W3C TPAC</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  thanks all, let&apos;s chat next week.</div>
