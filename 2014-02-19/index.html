<div class="information">Joseph Potvin is scribing.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Natasha may join in later to talk about the Web/Mobile payments task force</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  Is there a quick update on any organizational things based on Web Payments Workshop. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: Web Payments Workshop</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Paper reviews are due by the end of March. I think we&apos;re currently overbooked for the workshop - lots and lots of interest.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  Could we have a BoF? Would they be against it in principle? If there are any side meetings, could someone locate a nice cafe nearby if it doesn&apos;t interfere w/ the main agenda. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  A BoF would be great in principles, but the venue doesn&apos;t support it. Side meetings at some cafe nearby? Maybe we can find a venue adjacent to the Palais - pub, cafe. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div id="action-1" class="action">ACTION: Manu to ask Web Payments Workshop Program Committee to list potential BoF venues.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The workshop is single track, nobody is going to want to leave the venue for a BoF. [scribe assist by Brent Shambaugh]</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Web Payments Introductory Documents</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We&apos;ve not had a number of in-depth conversations with people in economics, writing,  programming that want to get involved, but not sure how.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We have lots of specs, hard to locate an entry point - we need better documentation</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We don&apos;t  have an overview or fucntional flow document - that could be what they work on.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Need this for entry-points as well as big-picture, those could be other work items.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Any other ideas?  We have 3 volunteers, need an outline, the volunteers can fill it out</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Brent, weren&apos;t you one of the volunteers for this?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Brent Shambaugh</span>:  Going thorugh things right now, and will try to map this.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Ok great, we&apos;ll do that as a starting point, do you want us to draft an outline? [scribe assist by Dave Longley]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Brent Shambaugh</span>:  Would it help if i just went ahead and drafted the outline? [scribe assist by Dave Longley]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If you could draft an outline based on what you&apos;ve read that would be very helpful, you have a fresh set of eyes on this and we&apos;ve been too entrenched for too long. [scribe assist by Dave Longley]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  That would be great if you could do that with your new perspective, and then just post that to the mailing list and we&apos;ll discuss it [scribe assist by Dave Longley]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Anything else on the intro docs? [scribe assist by Dave Longley]</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Update on the Google Summer of Code 2014</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We submitted the CG as a mentor organization to the Google Summer of Code</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/wiki/GSoC2014ProjectIdeas">https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/wiki/GSoC2014ProjectIdeas</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Wide variety of possible topics, 3 categories (novices, intermediate, advanced)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Students can apply, salary is about $5500 to pay for expenses to work on the project over the summer</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  All WPCG projects are open source, open standard</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We just wait now  to see if we&apos;re approved.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>: <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014">https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  GSoC organizations will be announced on Feb 24.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If accepted, we need to make some noise about our projects so we can recruit students.</div>
<h1 id="topic-4" class="topic">Topic: Web Commerce API</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-commerce-api/">https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-commerce-api/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  This is the resurrected Mozpay API that we covered a few weeks ago.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Based on our consultation, the workshop focus may be on payments request and digital receipts, this spec describes how we can do that.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  This allows all proprietary player to stay as-is, but also new entrants into the marketplace.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The approach seems to work for proprietary payment providers, cryptocurrency wallets, and open payment solutions, but it is not yet an official work item</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We would need to vote on this as a WPCG work item</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  How did we manage to leave it off the charter vote? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Mozilla retracted it before we voted on the charter, we resurrected it a week after we voted on the charter. It was just bad timing, which is funny because this could be the most important spec we do.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  It was too browser specific at first, but others determined that it could be made generic, which we did.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Mozilla is okay with using it again, and will decide later on support.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Can be later implemented in browsers, doesn&apos;t require browser buy-in at first.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I&apos;m in support of including it as a work item.</div>
<div class="proposal"><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong>  Start an official vote on adopting the Web Commerce API as a work item for the Web Payments Community Group.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Brent Shambaugh</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>: +1</div>
<div id="resolution-1" class="resolution"><strong>RESOLUTION:</strong> Start an official vote on adopting the Web Commerce API as a work item for the Web Payments Community Group.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Brent Shambaugh</span>:  I&apos;m concerned about there being so much focus on Bitcoin that PaySwarm may be lost in the excitement, what does PaySwarm provide that Bitcoin doesn&apos;t? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Basically, it standardizes the payment process for the web. The payment request and the response format. Bitcoin doesn&apos;t do that. It also promotes a solid identity solution for the Web, which Bitcoin doesn&apos;t have either. How to list assets for sale in a decentralized way, how to provide machine-readable offers of sale (listings). How to do digital receipts, there&apos;s a lot that it does that Bitcoin doesn&apos;t because PaySwarm is more high-level than these other protocols. It deals w/ the commerce layer, not the payment clearing layer. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Right now, there is no standard way to initiate a payment and know that the payment happened, that&apos;s basically what PaySwarm provides. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<h1 id="topic-5" class="topic">Topic: Persona and Web Identity Spec</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_AAR">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_AAR</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Mozilla put out something confusing, an After Action Review, which they typically only do after they tombstone a product. </div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Idea was a simple web login mechanism, things going well, pushed it for a while, but then leaders left Mozilla, and now there is a worry that Mozilla is going to pull the rest of the developers off of the project. I don&apos;t know anything yet, but it seems suspicious and is typically what Mozilla does before they wind down a project.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  This is an issue for Web Payments because we depends on Persona for a clean login solution.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The customer&apos;s payments provider is identified with the login.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   If the technology is orphaned, we&apos;ll need an alternative solution.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Mozilla probably has a continuity plan, but we just don&apos;t know what it is yet.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We&apos;ve elaborated in the Web Identity spec a bit here: <a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-identity/">https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-identity/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Scroll here to see the changes: <a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-identity/#a-typical-identity">https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-identity/#a-typical-identity</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  ID is composed of data, and some assertions (some 3rd party validates your data, with a digital signature)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Identity validation is very important to trusted payments, and login is very important to ease of use. We also need to talk about the name.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Web Identity and WebID are different specs, the differences are confusing some folks.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The proposal would be to change the title of the &quot;Web Identity&quot; spec to &quot;Identity Assertions&quot; [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  If the spec goes to &quot;identity assertions&quot;, is this an assertion validation spec in general? Maybe we should take &quot;identity&quot; out of the title? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We want to be careful about scope creep, the general technology can be used for assertions on just about anything. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  I wouldn&apos;t expand the scope of work, but the choice of the name doesn&apos;t mean we need to increase the scope. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Maybe we could say &quot;Entity Assertions&quot;? Maybe identifier for an entity? Depends on where we want to go with that. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  Identity could get us into problems w/ metadata that goes into identity. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Web Assertions is okay - how to make assertions on things on the Web. Maybe people could say that assertions are too broad? Validation is the wrong word?  [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  It&apos;s more like you&apos;re verifying / validating? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  Wouldn&apos;t you get Identity Assertions anyway? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We could say that this is just about identity - &quot;Identity Assertions&quot; and say that others can use this same approach for other technologies. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yeah, I guess we can do that. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  Does this have to be limited to a person? What about a corporation? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  A thing?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yes, included</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>: bike Shed... resource assertions?  does that fit into the semantic terminology better?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yes, we&apos;re talking about &quot;Entity Assertions&quot; [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  But we may just want to use a more understandable name for the spec title. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Entities with URL</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think identity assertions says what the spec is for? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Brent Shambaugh</span>:  How does the identity data get handled?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We say there has to be a way to read/write data to that entity, and to request that info</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Data lives with your service provider, somewhwere on the web, document you are served, for example</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yeah, so for example - <a href="https://dev.payswarm.com/i/manu">https://dev.payswarm.com/i/manu</a> [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The spec outlines how the requests for the info are issued and answered, under what conditions</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The person who owns that identity controls the access to the entity&apos;s info</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  So do we have a proposal to rename the spec?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  I still think the &quot;Identity Assertions&quot; name is strange... seems like there are a lot of pieces to this. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Joseph Potvin</span>:  I think that it might be bad that people associated &quot;identity&quot; with &quot;people&quot;. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think that&apos;s a good thing. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think that&apos;s an advantage... isn&apos;t it?  [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  A more generic name &quot;Entity Assertion&quot; will be more difficult. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We could talk about &quot;Identity Exchange&quot; or some other synonym to &quot;read/write&quot;? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  The spec does provide more than that - it&apos;s a readable / writable identity. Part of that is being able to write stuff to the identity. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David I. Lehn</span>:  What&apos;s the scope of the spec? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Creating a readable/writable identity where pieces of that identity can be modified. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  There&apos;s nothing to say that people can add things to do this in another way. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We should get the message across about &quot;Read, write, verify identity&quot; [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Brent Shambaugh</span>: We Could do Agent Identity or Agent Assertion, is that vague?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yeah, anything w/ &quot;Agent&quot; typically means &quot;software&quot; wrt. Web technologies, so it might be confusing.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Ok, we&apos;re out of time and we don&apos;t have consensus. Let&apos;s think about this offline, perhaps something better will come to us.</div>
